         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/june2023</link>
         <description>Real pay continues to fall 11 July 2023 Although average total pay (including bonuses) and regular pay (excluding bonuses) continued to rise compared with the previous year, real wages which are adjusted for inflation (price rises) fell over the same period. According to the latest labour market data, average total pay (including bonuses) for UK employees rose by 6.9% in March to May 2023 compared with the same period the previous year. Regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 7.3%, which was also seen last month and during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. By contrast, real terms total pay (adjusted for inflation) fell by 1.2% and regular pay dropped by 0.8% over the same period. Job vacancies also continued to fall in April to June 2023 by 85,000 to 1.034 million. The estimated number of vacancies fell on the quarter for the 12th consecutive period. The UK employment rate rose again by 0.2 percentage points to 76.0% in March to May 2023, an increase driven mainly by part-time employees. UK unemployment also increased by 0.2 percentage points to 4.0%. The economic inactivity rate (people not in work or looking for work) dropped by 0.4 percentage points, down to 20.8% during March to May 2023. This was largely driven by those who were inactive for other reasons, those looking after family or home, andâ€¯those who areâ€¯retired. Labour disputes led to around 128,000 lost working days in May 2023, fewer than half as many working days as in April 2023, and the lowest number since July 2022.

         <description>UK GDP estimated to have fallen by 0.1% in May 2023 13 July 2023 Monthly real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have fallen by 0.1% in May 2023, with the production sector being the main contributor. This follows growth of 0.2% in April 2023. Looking at the broader picture, GDP showed no growth in the three months to May 2023 compared with the three months to February 2023. Production output fell by 0.6% in May 2023 after a fall of 0.2% in April 2023, revised up from a fall of 0.3% in the previous publication. This sector was the main contributor to the fall in monthly GDP in May. Services output showed no growth in May 2023, following a growth 0.3% in April 2023. Within the sector the largest increase came from Human health and social work activities, largely driven by an increase of 1.8% in Human health activities after falls in March and April. The construction sector fell by 0.2% in May 2023 following a fall of 0.9% in April 2023, revised down from a fall of 0.6% in the previous publication.

Imports from non-EU countries rose by Â£1.3 billion while imports from EU countries grew by Â£0.7 billion. After removing the effect of inflation, imports of goods increased by 5.9%. The rise in imports from the EU was because of an increase in imports of cars from Germany, likely linked to the easing of supply chain issues. Imports from EU countries have been consistently greater than from non-EU countries since the end of 2022. The value of goods exports fell by Â£1.4 billion (4.4%) in May 2023. Exports to the EU decreased by Â£1.1 billion and exports to non-EU countries fell by Â£0.3 billion. After removing the effect of inflation, exports of goods fell by 3.2%.
