         <title>Cost of living crisis continues to damage retail sales </title>

         <description>Cost of living crisis continues to damage retail sales 20 October 2023 The cost of living crisis and its effect on shoppers has seen reduced spending at shops in Great Britain. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff bought), have fallen 0.9% in September 2023, following a rise of 0.4% the previous month. Despite the small growth in August 2023, sales volumes in the three months to September 2023 were down 0.8% compared with the previous quarter. Non-food stores saw some of the biggest drops in retail sales (1.9%) in September 2023. Shops reported that the pressures of the cost of living crisis, as well as September’s heatwave reducing sales of autumn clothing, contributed to a poor month. Similarly, non-store retailing (mostly online shops) saw a decline in sales volumes of 2.2% in September 2023. This follows a drop of 0.9% in August 2023. Despite the overall monthly decline, some sectors did experience an increase in sales volumes. Food stores saw a 0.2% increase in September 2023, following a 1.4% rise the previous month. Automotive fuel sales also partially bounced back from a 1.0% fall in August 2023 to a 0.8% rise last month. When compared with their pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) level in February 2020, total retail sales were 17.1% higher in value terms, but volumes were 2.5% lower.

However, it still spent more than it received in taxes and other income, requiring it to borrow £14.3 billion. While growth in central government tax receipts has been slowing in recent months, it remains stronger than in the years running up to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Inflation (the rate at which the price of goods and services rise) continues to put upward pressure on public spending. September saw increases for central government pay and procurement, along with uprated benefit payments. However, the interest payable on central government’s outstanding debt reduced by £7.2 billion compared with September last year. This was the third-lowest amount in any single month since monthly records began in 1997. Read our latest bulletin on UK public sector finances . 🠕 Back to the top</description>

         <description>Half of adults say cost of living has risen in last month 20 October 2023 More than half (52%) of adults across Great Britain say that their cost of living has increased compared with a month ago. This is according to those asked between 4 and 15 October 2023 as part of our latest Public opinions and social trends bulletin. However, that was down from 79% among those asked during a similar period one year ago (29 September to 9 October 2022). Despite the drop, 90% said the cost of living was an important issue facing the UK today, a higher percentage than those citing the NHS, the economy, climate change and the environment, or housing.

         <title>Lowest rents not affordable for lowest income households </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/privaterentalaffordabilityengland/latest</link>
         <description>Lowest rents not affordable for lowest income households 23 October 2023 Lower-priced private rents were not affordable for households on lower incomes, according to our latest bulletin on private rental affordability. For households on the lower 25% of incomes, the cheapest 25% of private rents equalled more than 30% of their household income in the year to March 2022. This was the case in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. An area’s rents are not considered affordable if privately-renting households would have to spend more than 30% of their income on rent. For median and higher-income households, rents were more affordable, and below the 30% threshold. Private renters on median household incomes in England could expect to spend 26% of their income on rent. In Wales, they could expect to spend 23% and in Northern Ireland the figure was 25%. Average rents sat below the 30% of income threshold in all English regions apart from London, where the median rents were 35% of the median private-renting household income.

         <title>More business creations than closures for the first time in two years </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/businessdemographyquarterlyexperimentalstatisticsukjulytoseptember2023</link>
         <description>More business creations than closures for the first time in two years 26 October 2023 In July to September 2023, the number of UK business creations was higher than the number of business closures. This is the first time this has happened since April to June 2021. A total of 78,655 businesses were added to the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) (business creations) in the UK in July to September 2023. This was 15% higher than in the same period in 2022, which saw the lowest number of business creations since the start of the quarterly data series in January to March 2017. There was an increase in creations in 13 out of 16 main industrial groups in July to September 2023 compared with the same period in 2022. The most significant increase came in the professional, scientific and technical activities industries, where business creations were up by 34%. The number of businesses removed from the IDBR (business closures) in the UK in July to September 2023 was 69,445. This is 14% lower than the same period in 2022, with 10 out of 16 main industrial groups showing a decrease in closures. The most significant decrease in closures came in the transport and storage industries (down 41%). Within transport and storage, unlicensed carriers (down 51%) showed the most significant fall. Data in this release are experimental statistics, so care needs to be taken when interpreting them. Our annual Business demography publication remains the best source of information on business demography.

         <description>A third of working adults think AI will put their job at risk 30 October 2023 Around a third (32%) of working adults (in employment or self-employed) in Great Britain think artificial intelligence (AI) would put their job at risk. This is according to new ONS analysis of public awareness, opinions and expectations about AI . Almost 3 in 10 (28%) thought AI could make their job easier. Those in management and professional roles were significantly more likely to think AI would make their job easier than those in other occupations. Those working in professional occupations were among the most likely to think AI could make their job easier Proportion of employed or self-employed adults reporting AI could make their job easier by occupation (SOC 2020), Great Britain, 26 July to 1 October 2023 Source: Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Download this chart Those working in professional occupations were among the most likely to think AI could make their job easier Image .csv .xls More than 4 in 10 of those working in professional occupations (41%) and 34% of those in managerial roles thought AI could make their job easier. Those working in administrative and secretarial roles (43%) and sales and customer service (41%) were among the most likely to think AI could put their job at risk. Among all adults, those most likely to agree AI will benefit them individually included men, younger age groups, those with a degree and those in professional or managerial jobs.

         <title>Majority of homes in most areas have an EPC rating below C</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/energyefficiencyofhousinginenglandandwales2023</link>
         <description>Majority of homes in most areas have an EPC rating below C 1 November 2023 In the majority of council areas across England and Wales, at least half of homes have energy efficiency ratings of D or below. Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) indicate the energy efficiency of homes, with ratings from band A (most efficient) to band G (least efficient). The UK government has said it wants as many homes as possible to reach band C by 2035. More energy efficient homes tend to require less energy to heat, which in turn reduces energy costs as well as carbon dioxide emissions. Of all local authority districts, 26% had more than half of their dwellings at band C or above as of March 2023. Of those, just over half (52%) were in London or the South East. The median energy efficiency rating for all homes, both in England and in Wales, was band D. The median is the middle value of all the energy efficiency ratings. Older properties tend to be less energy efficient. Of all homes built before 1930 in both England and Wales, more than 80% were rated in bands D to G. Newer homes are more likely to have higher EPC ratings Individual Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) bands by age of property band, England and Wales, up to March 2023 Embed code Embed this interactive Copy Read our Energy efficiency of housing in England and Wales: 2023 article 🠕 Back to the top</description>

         <title>Employee earnings fell 1.5% after inflation in April 2023</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2023</link>
         <description>Employee earnings fell 1.5% after inflation in April 2023 1 November 2023 Median (middle) earnings for full-time employees was £682 in April 2023, which is a 6.2% increase over the £642 in April 2022; this is the highest growth since comparable records began in 1997. This represented a growth across all major occupational groups, particularly for lower-paying occupations (with caring, leisure and other service occupations up 9.4% and sales and customer service occupations up 9.2% compared with the previous year). However, overall, median earnings fell 1.5% on the year in real terms (adjusted for inflation using Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH)).

         <title>Around a third of adults unaware of important energy support schemes </title>

         <description>Around a third of adults unaware of important energy support schemes 3 November 2023 Around a third of adults in Great Britain have not heard of important government schemes that could help with their energy bills this winter. That is according to those surveyed between 18 and 29 October 2023 for our latest Public opinions and social trends bulletin. Of those asked, 36% had not heard of any of the government schemes they were asked about, such as the Energy Price Guarantee or the Warm Home Discount. The survey also revealed that about 4 in 10 adults (39%) who pay energy bills said it was very or somewhat difficult to afford them. This was compared with 42% during a similar period one year ago (12 to 23 October 2022). Read our latest Public opinions and social trends bulletin 🠕 Back to the top One in five rentals had seen a 10% price rise in September 2023 3 November 2023 New experimental analysis has found that prices had risen by 10% or more for around one in five privately rented properties revisited in September 2023. Prices had risen by 10% or more for 21% of privately rented properties in England and 17% in Wales. The analysis tracks the price changes of individual privately rented properties over time. On average, properties are revisited (and prices recorded) every 12 months in England, and every nine months in Wales. Of properties in England revisited between July and September 2023, prices had risen since the last visit for around 6 in 10 properties. In Wales, prices had risen for around 4 in 10 properties. In both countries, this is a higher proportion than last year (July to September 2022). While rental prices were more likely to have increased recently in England than in Wales, when a property’s price did increase, the average increase was higher in Wales (11.3%) than in England (9.7%). In all English regions, properties revisited between July and September 2023 were more likely to have seen price rises of 10% or more, compared with properties revisited between July and September 2022. In London, almost a quarter of privately rented homes revisited in July to September 2023 had seen price rises of 10% or more since the last visit.

         <title>UK real GDP showed no growth in the third quarter of 2023</title>

         <description>UK real GDP showed no growth in the third quarter of 2023 10 November 2023 The first quarterly estimate for Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2023 shows the UK economy was broadly unchanged following modest growth of 0.2% in the previous quarter. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the value of all goods and services produced in the UK after adjusting for price changes over time. GDP growth continued to slow in the most recent quarter UK, Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2022 to Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2023 Source: GDP first quarterly estimate from the Office for National Statistics Download this chart GDP growth continued to slow in the most recent quarter Image .csv .xls Following no growth in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2023, service sector output decreased by 0.1% in Quarter 3 2023 driven by falls of 0.4% and 1.2% in real estate activities, and transportation and storage, respectively. There was no growth in production output in Quarter 3 2023, despite a 0.1% increase in manufacturing. Elsewhere, construction output rose by 0.1%. Growth in the volume of net trade (defined by the difference in exported and imported goods and services) was offset by falls in business investment (down 4.2%), household spending (down 0.4%) and government consumption (down 5.0%) in the most recent quarter. Business investment fell by 4.2% in the latest quarter following growth of 4.1% in Quarter 2 2023 because of increases in transport investment, especially in aircraft imports from the United States in April 2023. Households reduced their spending in the three months to September 2023, in particular their spending on “miscellaneous” goods and services (such as jewellery, clocks and watches), air and water transport, and food and non- alcoholic drink. Government consumption fell on the quarter, mainly reflecting lower spending on health and education. Read our latest bulletin on UK quarterly GDP. 🠕 Back to the top Total imports of goods decreased substantially in September 10 November 2023 Total imports of goods in &quot;current prices&quot;, which are not adjusted for inflation, decreased by £2.9 billion (6.2%) in September 2023. Imports from non-EU countries fell by £1.5 billion, while imports from the-EU fell by £1.4 billion. Total exports of goods decreased by £0.9 billion (2.9%) in September 2023, because of a £0.5 billion fall in exports to the EU and a £0.4 billion fall to non-EU countries. After removing the effect of inflation, total goods imports decreased by £2.3 billion (5.7%) in September 2023. This was because imports from the EU fell by £0.9 billion (4.2%) and imports from non-EU countries fell by £1.3 billion (7.7%). Total goods exports fell by £0.6 billion (2.1%) in September 2023, after the effect of inflation is removed. Exports to the EU decreased by £0.4 billion (3.4%) and exports to non-EU countries fell by £0.1 billion (0.9%). The total trade in goods and services deficit narrowed by £7.1 billion to £6.0 billion in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2023 , the result of a substantial fall in imports; the total trade deficit has declined steadily since Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2022 when it stood at £26.9 billion.
