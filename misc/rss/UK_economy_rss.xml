         <title>Shoppers buy more overall but cut back on food </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/retailsalesgreatbritainmay2023</link>
         <description>Shoppers buy more overall but cut back on food 23 June 2023 Shoppers across Britain bought more overall in May 2023, although retailers suggest a drop in the amount bought in food stores could be down to higher prices. Retail sales volumes across Britain are estimated to have risen by 0.3% in May 2023, following a rise of 0.5% in April 2023. Non-store retail sales volumes rose by 2.7% in May because of strong sales by online retailers selling outdoor-related goods and summer clothing. This was boosted by the warm weather in the second half of the month, according to feedback from retailers. However, shoppers bought less in food stores in May, with retailers suggesting that the increased cost of living and food prices continue to affect sales. There was also some evidence that the 0.5% fall in food store sales volumes over the month could be partly down to higher spending on takeaways and fast food. This may have been because of the extra bank holiday for the coronation of King Charles III on 8 May.

         <title>Trade surplus in all UK nations in 2021</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/internationaltradeinuknationsregionsandcities2021</link>
         <description>Trade surplus in all UK nations in 2021 28 June 2023 There was a trade surplus in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales in 2021. This means that the value of goods and services exported from each nation was higher than the value of goods and services imported to each nation. England had a trade deficit until the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, when the value of imports fell by more than the value of exports. Compared with before the pandemic (2018), exports increased in London, the North West, Scotland and the East of England, but fell in all other nations and English regions. Total exports in London, East of England, the North West and Scotland have returned to pre-pandemic levels Total trade exports by International Territorial Level (ITL) 1 region, UK, 2018 to 2021 Embed code Embed this interactive Copy Notes: Extra-regio includes parts of the national economic territory which cannot be attached directly to a single region including some offshore oil transactions and territorial enclaves. Download the data .xlsx In London, the rise was driven by exports of services, while increases in Scotland and the North East were driven by exports in goods. In the East of England, exports of both goods and services rose. The region is home to multiple medical, pharmaceutical and bioscientific research institutions, which may have boosted exports in response to the pandemic. Meanwhile, imports fell in all nations and English regions, with the largest falls in the South East and the West Midlands.

         <title>Output per hour worked decreased in Quarter 1 2023 </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/productivityoverviewukjanuarytomarch2023</link>
         <description>Output per hour worked decreased in Quarter 1 2023 07 July 2023 Labour productivity in the UK, measured as output per hour worked, was 0.6% below in the year to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2023 when compared with the same quarter a year ago. The decrease was driven by growth in hours worked (0.8%) being larger than growth in gross value added (GVA), which was at 0.2%. Excluding the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic period, Quarter 1 2023 saw the largest fall in output per hour worked since Quarter 1 2013. Compared with pre-pandemic levels (2019 average), output per hour worked grew 0.6% in Quarter 1 2023. This growth was driven by an increase of GVA of 0.6% since 2019. The number of hours worked remained constant over this period, with a growth of 0.0%. Other measures of productivity, such as output per worker and output per job, were 0.9% and 1.0% below their respective Quarter 1 2022 levels. This is because of higher growth in the number of workers (1.1%) and jobs (1.2%) than in GVA (0.2%). Administrative service and construction industries made the biggest upwards industry contribution to annual productivity growth (output per hour worked) as of Quarter 1 2023. In contrast, finance and insurance and real estate industries showed the biggest negative contribution to productivity growth.

         <title>Real pay continues to fall</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/june2023</link>
         <description>Real pay continues to fall 11 July 2023 Although average total pay (including bonuses) and regular pay (excluding bonuses) continued to rise compared with the previous year, real wages which are adjusted for inflation (price rises) fell over the same period. According to the latest labour market data, average total pay (including bonuses) for UK employees rose by 6.9% in March to May 2023 compared with the same period the previous year. Regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 7.3%, which was also seen last month and during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. By contrast, real terms total pay (adjusted for inflation) fell by 1.2% and regular pay dropped by 0.8% over the same period. Job vacancies also continued to fall in April to June 2023 by 85,000 to 1.034 million. The estimated number of vacancies fell on the quarter for the 12th consecutive period. The UK employment rate rose again by 0.2 percentage points to 76.0% in March to May 2023, an increase driven mainly by part-time employees. UK unemployment also increased by 0.2 percentage points to 4.0%. The economic inactivity rate (people not in work or looking for work) dropped by 0.4 percentage points, down to 20.8% during March to May 2023. This was largely driven by those who were inactive for other reasons, those looking after family or home, and those who are retired. Labour disputes led to around 128,000 lost working days in May 2023, fewer than half as many working days as in April 2023, and the lowest number since July 2022.
