         <title>Real value of pay continues to fall</title>

         <description>Real value of pay continues to fall 14 March 2023 Total pay (including bonuses) for employees rose by 5.7% in November 2022 to January 2023, compared with the previous year. Regular pay growth (excluding bonuses) was 6.5%. However, after adjusting for rising prices, real terms pay fell by 3.2% year-on-year for total pay and by 2.4% for regular pay. The number of job vacancies in the UK fell by 51,000 in December 2022 to February 2023, compared with the previous quarter. This is the eighth consecutive period in which vacancies fell on the quarter, reflecting uncertainty across industries. Employers continue to cite economic pressures as a factor in holding back on recruitment. The employment rate increased on the quarter in November 2022 to January 2023, driven by part-time employees and self-employed workers. The economic inactivity rate (those not in work and not actively seeking work) decreased in the same period, while the unemployment rate remained similar.

         <title>Cost of energy support schemes push borrowing to February record</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/comparingcensus2021andlabourforcesurveyestimatesofthelabourmarketenglandandwales/13march2023</link>
         <description>Cost of energy support schemes push borrowing to February record 21 March 2023 In February 2023, the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income, requiring it to borrow ¬£16.7 billion. This was ¬£9.7 billion more borrowing than that in February 2022 and the highest February borrowing since monthly records began in 1993. While central government tax receipts grew by a steady ¬£3.6 billion to ¬£58.4 billion compared to February last year, it wasn‚Äôt enough to offset the cost of the combined energy schemes provided to households and businesses in February 2023, provisionally estimated at around ¬£9.3 billion. The ¬£16.7 billion borrowed in February 2023 combined with a reduction of ¬£1.4 billion to our previously published financial year-to-January borrowing estimate brings the total borrowed in the financial year-to-February 2023 to ¬£132.2 billion. This was ¬£15.5 billion more borrowing than in the same period last year and the third highest financial year-to-February borrowing since monthly records began. Debt at the end of January was ¬£2.5 trillion (¬£2,507.3 billion) or 99.2% of the UK‚Äôs annual gross domestic product (GDP).

Those born in EU countries had the highest percentage in employment, at 70.8%, 58.0% of those not born in the EU were employed, and those born in the UK had the lowest employment percentage, at 55.9%. This variation can be partially explained by the age profile of the different population groups. Migrant groups tend to be younger than the UK-born and younger people are more likely to be in employment than older people. This is shown when looking at the 16 to 64 years population (working age), where 71.2% of the UK-born were in employment compared with 78.2% of the EU-born in this age group. Professional occupations (such as doctors, nurses and teachers) was the most common occupational group for most migrant groups. Around a third (35.7%) of those born in Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island nations (known as ‚ÄúAntarctica, Oceania and other‚Äù) were employed in this occupational group. When breaking down the economy into 21 industrial sectors, we see that country of birth groups have different distributions among the industries. Nearly a quarter (24.3%) of those working in the wholesale trade industry were born outside the UK. Two in five of those working in the manufacture of food products industry were born outside the UK (40.4%). Notes: Estimates from Census 2021 will differ to those collected on the Labour Force Survey because of a range of conceptual differences between the two sources. Our Comparing Census 2021 and Labour Force Survey estimates of the labour market, England and Wales article provides more detail. ü†ï Back to the top</description>

         <title>House price growth slows as private rents rise at record rate</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/consumerpriceinflationukfebruary2023</link>
         <description>House price growth slows as private rents rise at record rate 22 March 2023 Growth in UK house prices continued to slow in the year to January 2023. During that time, average house prices in the UK increased by 6.3%, down from 9.3% in December 2022. The average price of a house was ¬£290,000, which is ¬£17,000 higher than the same month a year ago. House prices grew the least in Scotland at a rate of 1.0%, which was lower than all English regions and was lower than the rates seen across England (6.9%) and Wales (5.8%). North East house prices increased more than any other region All dwellings annual house price rates of change, by English region, year to January 2023 Source: HM Land Registry and UK House Price Index from the Office for National Statistics Download this chart North East house prices increased more than any other region Image .csv .xls Private rental prices continued to rise at record-setting paces in all countries in the 12 months to February 2023. The average price tenants paid for private rentals in the UK increased 4.7% during that time, up from 4.4% in the 12 months to January 2023. Rental prices in Scotland increased by 4.9%, up from 4.5% in the previous month and the highest rate since records began in 2012. England and Wales also saw record growth in private rental prices, at 4.5% and 4.2%, respectively.

Affordability is calculated as the ratio of the average (median) house price to the average (median) yearly earnings in a given area. A lower ratio can be understood as greater affordability. Overall in England, a full-time employee in 2022 could typically expect to spend 8.3 times their annual earnings buying a home in the local authority in which they work, so the affordability ratio was 8.3. This is lower than the ratio of 9.1 recorded the previous year. In Wales, this ratio was 6.2, which is not statistically different from the previous year. In 2022, only 7% of local authorities in England and Wales had an affordability ratio below 5, down from 89% in 1997. Changes in house prices have been the primary driver of changing affordability. Although earnings have doubled in the past 25 years, house prices are 4.5 times higher. Affordability has worsened as house price inflation outpaced earnings growth House price and earnings indices, England and Wales, 1997 to 2022 Source: House Price Statistics for Small Areas and Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings from the Office for National Statistics Download this chart Affordability has worsened as house price inflation outpaced earnings growth Image .csv .xls The worsening affordability is especially true in London, where no local authority has an affordability ratio below 10. This is contrasted with the North East, the only region where no local authority had an affordability ratio over 10.

As measured by the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers‚Äô housing costs (CPIH), the annual inflation rate rose to 9.2% in February 2023. This was up from 8.8% the previous month, but below a recent peak of 9.6% in October 2022. Since then, the annual inflation rate has fluctuated around 9.2%, a rate previously seen between September and December 1990. The reason for the rise in the annual inflation rate was a 1.0% rise in prices between January and February 2023, compared with 0.7% in the same period in 2022. Larger price rises in restaurants and hotels were some of the main reasons for the rise in the annual inflation rate. The annual inflation rate for restaurants and hotels was 12.1% in February 2023, up from 10.8% in January, and the highest rate since the constructed historical estimate of 12.1% in July 1991.

         <title>Drop in number of online job adverts</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/economicactivityandsocialchangeintheukrealtimeindicators23march2023</link>
         <description>Drop in number of online job adverts 23 March 2023 The number of online job adverts fell in the week to 17 March 2023, continuing a general decline since early last year. The total number of online job adverts decreased by 2% compared with the previous week, according to data from search engine Adzuna, with the number of adverts declining in 24 of 28 job categories. The overall figure was also 14% lower than in the equivalent period of 2022. UK retail footfall (a measure of consumer activity) increased by 9% in the week to 19 March 2023, according to data from analytics firm Springboard, and was 4% above levels recorded during the equivalent week last year. However, it was still below the level recorded in the equivalent week of 2019. Figures from financial tech company Revolut show debit card spending in the week to 19 March 2023 was broadly similar to levels seen in the previous week, although it was higher than during the equivalent week of 2022. Retail spending was 35 percentage points higher than a year earlier, which was the largest annual increase of any sector.

         <title>Discount store sales help boost retail spending in February</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/retailsalesgreatbritainfebruary2023</link>
         <description>Discount store sales help boost retail spending in February 24 March 2023 Retail sales volumes (the amount bought in shops) rose by 1.2% across Great Britain in February 2023, following a rise of 0.9% in January. However, these are down 3.5% on the same month last year, as volumes sold fell throughout 2022. The amount sold in non-food stores saw a rise of 2.4% in the month because of strong sales in discount department stores. Department store sales volumes rose 5.5%, and clothing stores rose by 2.9%. Food store sales volumes rose 0.9% in February 2023, which may be because of reduced spending in pubs and restaurants as people eat in more because of cost of living pressures. The amount spent in retail stores (values) rose by 1.6% between January and February 2023, as inflation has led to higher prices. While the amount bought in retail stores returned to pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic February 2020 levels in the latest month, the amount spent was 16.8% higher.
