         <title>ONS launches shopping prices comparison tool</title>

         <description>ONS launches shopping prices comparison tool 03 May 2023 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has released a new tool allowing you to compare the average prices of over 450 items in the consumer prices inflation basket. In the past year, 95% of these items have increased in price , with cucumbers (up 52%), olive oil (up 49%) and hard cheese (up 44%) seeing the largest increases. The tool contains items ranging from bananas to nursery fees and aims to help improve the accessibility of existing ONS data by easily allowing users to track average price trends. As well as showing average price changes on an item-by-item basis, the tool also lets you create your own bespoke basket of items and calculate the total average price change across these items. For example, a roast dinner for four people, including a whole chicken weighing (1.5kg), white potatoes (1kg), carrots (1 kg), broccoli (350g) and butter (100g), could cost ¬£8.68 on average in March 2023, based on a 2023 sample. This is ¬£1.68 more than in March 2022, with broccoli recording the highest increase at 34%. The tool will be updated every month to reflect the latest inflation data and will be refreshed each March to accommodate the latest changes to the items in the inflation basket . ü†ï Back to the top</description>

The monthly falls in both imported and exported goods, were primarily because of decreases in trade with non-EU countries, while trade with the EU remained stable.

Our Impact of trade in goods data collection changes on UK trade statistics articles provide more detail.

All other commodities remained stable in March. The quarterly trade in goods deficit narrowed by ¬£8.9 billion to ¬£55.0 billion in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2023, while the trade in services surplus widened by ¬£1.3 billion to ¬£39.8 billion.

March 2023 had the highest construction output (¬£15,616 million) since records began. The increase in monthly construction output was caused by a 0.7% increase in new work, while repair and maintenance decreased by 0.6%. The increase in construction output compared to March 2022 was caused by a 6.1% increase in repair and maintenance, and a 2.8% increase in new work. At the sector level, the main reasons for the monthly increase were increases in ‚Äúinfrastructure new work‚Äù and ‚Äúpublic other new work‚Äù sectors; which increased by 2.2% (¬£51 million) and 6.5% (¬£48 million), respectively. Construction output increased 0.7% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2023 compared with Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2022. This increase came solely from a rise in repair and maintenance (4.9%), as new work saw a decrease of 1.9%. Total construction new orders decreased by 12.4% (A decrease of ¬£1,571 million) in Quarter 1 2023 compared with Quarter 4 2022; this quarterly fall came mainly from ‚Äúprivate commercial‚Äù and ‚Äúprivate housing new orders‚Äù, which fell 22.3% (¬£773 million) and 18.4% (¬£607 million), respectively. The annual rate of construction output price growth was 8.5% in the 12 months to March 2023; this has slowed slightly from the record annual price growths in both May 2022 and June 2022 (10.4%).
