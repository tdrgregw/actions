         <title>Value of UK goods imports and exports rose in 2022</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/uktradeingoodsyearinreview2022</link>
         <description>Value of UK goods imports and exports rose in 2022 17 February 2023 The value of total goods imports increased by Â£155.5 billion (32.3%) and the value of total goods exports increased by Â£66.2 billion (20.8%) in 2022 when compared with 2021. However, after removing the effect of inflation (the rising price of goods and services), total goods imports increased by Â£53.2 billion (11.5%) and total goods exports increased by just Â£9.1 billion (2.9%) compared with 2021. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was a leading contributor to higher prices. It disrupted trade in multiple commodities, forced the UK to change some trade partners and led to increased import prices. The value of fuel imports increased by Â£63.6 billion (119.1%) in 2022 when compared with 2021, driven by European gas prices reaching record levels. High fuel prices also had a knock-on effect on the price of other commodities because of increased transport and production costs. In December 2022, the Sterling to Euro exchange rate stood at 1.16, while the Sterling to Dollar exchange rate stood at 1.21. In both cases, these rates are down compared with the average exchange rate in 2021. Weaker exchange rates will have made the prices of imports higher while reducing the prices of UK exports.

         <title>Renters and parents more likely to be financially vulnerable</title>

         <description>Renters and parents more likely to be financially vulnerable 20 February 2023 Renters, younger adults (aged 25 to 34 years) and parents living with dependent children were among the groups most likely to experience some form of financial vulnerability. Adults were considered to have experienced some form of financial vulnerability if three or more of the following applied to them: being unable to afford an unexpected, but necessary, expense of Â£850 borrowing more money or using more credit than usual in the last month, compared with a year ago being unable to save in the next 12 months finding it very or somewhat difficult to afford energy bills Adults aged 25 to 34 years had the highest odds of experiencing some form of financial vulnerability compared with those aged 75 years and over. Parents living with dependent children and those on lower incomes were also more likely to have experienced financial vulnerability than those without or not living with dependent children, or those earning more than Â£50,000 per year. Renters had four times the odds of experiencing some form of financial vulnerability than those who owned their homes outright.

         <title>Record self-assessment receipts contribute to a January surplus</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/publicsectorfinancesukjanuary2023</link>
         <description>Record self-assessment receipts contribute to a January surplus 21 February 2023 In January 2023, the public sector spent less than it received in taxes and other income, resulting in a surplus of Â£5.4 billion. The UK government receives most of its annual self-assessed tax receipts in January. This year these receipts were partly offset by substantial spending on the energy support schemes and large one-off payments relating to historic customs duties owed to the EU. Self-assessed income tax receipts were Â£21.9 billion in January 2023. This is the highest January figure since monthly records began in April 1999, and Â£5.5 billion or one-third higher than in January 2022. The Â£5.4 billion surplus in January 2023, combined with a reduction of Â£5.8 billion to our previously published financial year-to-December borrowing estimate, brings the total borrowed in the financial year-to-January to Â£116.9 billion. This was Â£7.0 billion more than was borrowed in the same period last year, but Â£30.6 billion below the official forecast on a like-for-like basis. Debt at the end of January was Â£2.5 trillion (Â£2,492.1 billion) or 98.9% of the UKâ€™s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

         <title>Winter spending rises as inflation drives up prices</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/howhasdiscretionaryspendingbeenimpactedinrecentwinters</link>
         <description>Winter spending rises as inflation drives up prices 21 February 2023 Non-essential consumer spending on sales days such as Boxing Day and Black Friday rose in winter 2022 to 2023, despite overall spending power being eroded. In the year to January 2023 retail sales values rose by 4.1% while sales volumes fell by 5.1%, as consumers spend more and buy less. Spending data from Revolut show consumer spending patterns in winter 2022-23 were generally in line with previous winters, despite cost of living pressures and widespread industrial action, alongside factors specific to this winter. Clothing and footwear sales volumes unexpectedly rose in November and December 2022, by 1.1% and 1.0% respectively. They peaked on Black Friday (25 November 2022) at 31.3% higher than Boxing Day and 77.0% higher than New Yearâ€™s Day. The week to Christmas Eve 2022 provided the largest cash value ever recorded for a trading week in the food sector, partly due to inflation, with the amount sold being similar to previous years. Industrial action carried out by rail and postal workers appears to have had no significant negative impact on travel spending, or in-store shopping, and the first ever winter FIFA World Cup did not result in substantial increases in spending on entertainment.

A quarter (25%) of trading businesses also expect to increase their prices in March 2023, according to our latest business insights and conditions survey. Energy prices remain the top reason trading businesses are considering doing so, with 35% citing this reason. For trading businesses in the accommodation and food service activities (hospitality) industry, 45% expect a rise in prices. We urge caution when interpreting questions on future expectations as the employees responding to the survey may not always have full oversight of the business.

         <title>Students hit by rising cost of living</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/costoflivingandhighereducationstudentsengland30januaryto13february2023</link>
         <description>Students hit by rising cost of living 24 February 2023 More than 9 in 10 university students in England say their cost of living has risen over the last year, with many worried it will negatively affect their studies. Some 92% of higher education students said their cost of living had increased compared with last year, according to a survey carried out between 30 January and 13 February 2023. Around half (49%) felt they had financial difficulties, with 33% saying these were minor and 16% saying they had major money problems. The survey data suggest this may be leading to higher debt levels, with 3 in 10 students (30%) saying they had taken on new debt in response to rising living costs, up from 25% in early November 2022. Of those, 71% said this was because their student loan did not cover their living costs. More than three-quarters (78%) of students were concerned that rising prices may affect how well they do in their studies, while more than a third (35%) reported they are now less likely to do further study after finishing their course. This could be affecting studentsâ€™ mental health, with around 46% reporting their mental health and well-being had worsened since the start of the Autumn term 2022.

         <description>Around 1 in 11 adults report running out of food 27 February 2023 Adults across Britain are experiencing food insecurity and are having to cut down on portion sizes or skip meals altogether. Around 1 in 11 adults (9%) reported they had often or sometimes run out of food and could not afford to buy more in the past month. That is according to figures from our Winter Survey tracking the impact of winter pressures, which were collected from 18 to 29 January 2023. Around one in eight (13%) said they had cut down on meal sizes or skipped meals altogether in the past month because there was not enough money for food. Of those, 21% reported having done so on more than 14 days in the month. The survey also shows that nearly one in five adults (18%) waiting for NHS treatment say they had an appointment cancelled or delayed in the past month. Around 3 in 10 (31%) employed or self-employed adults who were waiting for NHS treatment said it had affected their work. Reasons their work was affected that they cited included having to change working tasks, not going for promotion or training opportunities, and finding new employment.
