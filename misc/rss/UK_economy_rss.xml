         <description>Around 1 in 30 adults miss work because of industrial action 10 February 2023 Around 1 in 30 working adults reported that they missed work because of industrial action between 25 January and 5 February 2023. That is 3% of working adults across Britain, according to our latest Public Opinions and Social Trends Survey. That means 97% of respondents said they had not missed work as a result of industrial action. The survey period covers strike action by teachers, train drivers, civil servants and university staff, although the majority of responses came before the industrial action taken on 1 February. When asked about the important issues facing the UK today, 92% of adults cited the cost of living, which made it the most commonly reported issue. That was followed by the NHS (87%), the economy (77%), climate change and the environment (56%). There has been a slight increase in adults reporting the NHS as an important issue over the winter period, and a decrease in reporting climate change and the environment. This may be due to seasonal pressures and cold weather. The cost of living remains the most pressing concern Proportion of all adults in Great Britain, by issue, 26 October 2022 to 5 February 2023 Source: Office for National Statistics ‚Äì Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) Notes: Question: &quot;What do you think are important issues facing the UK today?&quot; Respondents were able to choose more than one option.

         <description>Young people least likely to work from home 13 February 2023 Younger workers continue to be least likely to only work from home (6%). Those aged 16 to 24 years had the highest rate of those travelling to work at 79%, while those aged 34 to 44 years had the lowest rate at 48%, in the period September 2022 to January 2023. The group aged 16 to 24 years also had the highest rate of workers who did not have the ability to work from home, with just under two in three (65%) reporting this. Those aged 25 to 34 years, 35 to 44 years, and 45 to 54 years reported higher rates of home or hybrid working compared with the group aged 16 to 24 years. 16- to 24-year-olds most likely to travel to work without the option to work from home Proportion of working adults in Great Britain, September 2022 to January 2023 Embed code Embed this interactive Copy Download the data The levels of people working from home peaked during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown at 49%. Throughout 2022 the percentage of adults who worked from home varied between 25% and 40%, without a clear upward or downward trend. Overall, 44% of workers reported home or hybrid working and 56% reported solely travelling to work in the last seven days. In the most recent period (25 January to 5 February 2023), 40% of working adults reported having worked from home at some point in the past seven days. A higher rate of workers travelling to work (46%) reported not being able to work from home compared with those who travelled to work but could work from home (10%).

Those living in rented housing were more than three times as likely to experience some form of food insecurity than those who own their home outright, according to analysis of the ONS‚Äôs Winter Survey data, collected between 22 November and 18 December 2022. ‚ÄúFood insecurity ‚Äù is when a household does not have enough food to lead a healthy life. We classed adults as experiencing some form of food insecurity if they reported one or more of the following: being worried that their food would run out before they could afford to buy more running out of food before they could afford more thinking they or their household could not afford to eat a balanced diet Adults in rented housing were also around three times more likely to experience some form of energy insecurity than those who own their homes outright. Adults were considered to be experiencing energy insecurity if they reported one or more of the following: being behind on gas or electricity bill payments finding it very difficult to afford their energy bills never or hardly ever being able to keep warm in their home Both food and energy insecurity were more likely among adults with an income below ¬£40,000 and ¬£30,000 per year, respectively, when compared with those earning ¬£40,000 or more.

         <description>One in five online job adverts in December 2022 were in London 13 February 2023 One in five jobs advertised online in December 2022 were in London, according to new experimental analysis of Textkernel data. The number of adverts in London was equal to more than 4% of the city‚Äôs working age population, higher than in any other UK region. Outside London, six local authorities (Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool) had the greatest share of online job adverts in December 2022; they also had the highest increase in their share of total adverts over the previous year. In the UK, the volume of online job adverts fell 56% between December 2021 and December 2022, although they remained above pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels, after sharp declines and subsequent increases in adverts during 2020 and 2021. The share of postings advertising healthcare jobs increased between 2021 and 2022, largely from an increase in demand for care assistants, nursing and specialised nurses. The share of adverts for jobs in sales and trading fell the most, followed by those in communication, marketing and public relations.

         <title>Labour disputes cost more than 800,000 working days in December 2022</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/uklabourmarketfebruary2023</link>
         <description>Labour disputes cost more than 800,000 working days in December 2022 14 February 2023 More working days were lost to labour disputes across the UK in December 2022 than in any other month since November 2011. A total of 843,000 working days were lost over the month, which was significantly more than the 461,000 recorded for November 2022. Our labour market data also show that the rate of annual regular (excluding bonuses) pay growth among employees was 6.7% between October and December 2022, which was the strongest growth rate seen outside of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Annual regular pay grew by 7.3% in the private sector and 4.2% in the public sector. However, regular pay fell in real terms by 2.5% over the period after adjusting for inflation (the rising cost of goods and services). The economic inactivity rate decreased by 0.3 percentage points in the three months to December 2022, to 21.4%. Estimates between July to September 2022 and October to December 2022 show that there was a record-high net flow out of economic inactivity, driven by people moving from economic inactivity to employment. The data also show that the number of vacancies fell by 76,000 in the three months to January 2023, to 1,134,000. That was the seventh consecutive quarterly fall since the three months to July 2022, with respondents to our survey continuing to cite economic pressures as a factor in holding back on recruitment.

         <description>Annual inflation continues to ease 15 February 2022 Prices of goods and services bought by consumers rose by 8.8% in the year to January 2023, down from 9.2% in the previous month, as the annual inflation rate continues to ease.

         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/businessinsightsandimpactontheuksinglesitesubnationaleconomyfebruary2023</link>
         <description>Worker shortages higher in Wales 16 February 2023 Single-site businesses in Wales reported the largest proportion of firms experiencing worker shortages in the UK in early January 2023 - 16% of businesses in Wales experienced shortages, compared with 12% across the UK. It means Wales overtakes Scotland, which previously consistently reported the largest proportion of single-site businesses reporting a shortage of workers between late August 2022 and late November 2022. Between late August 2022 and early January 2023, Scotland saw a fall from 18% to 12%. Of all four UK nations, businesses in England were the least likely to report worker shortages in early January 2023, at 11%. As well as worker shortages, businesses were asked if they had been affected by industrial action. Of single-site businesses within the UK, England reported the largest proportion affected by industrial action every month between July and December 2022 (except for August 2022). England also saw a rise in affected businesses in this period, from 7% to 16%. In December 2022, 5% of single-site businesses in Northern Ireland reported being affected by industrial action, 11 percentage points below the UK single-site total (16%).

         <title>Low carbon and renewable energy economy sees record growth</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/lowcarbonandrenewableenergyeconomyuk2021</link>
         <description>Low carbon and renewable energy economy sees record growth 16 February 2023 Economic growth and employment levels within the UK‚Äôs low carbon and renewable energy economy (LCREE) increased at record rates between 2020 and 2021. During that time, turnover (the amount received in sales from goods and services in a specified time period) increased 30.8% to ¬£54.4 billion, while employment increased by 16.4% to 247,400 full-time equivalent positions. These represent the largest annual changes recorded for both metrics since comparable records began in 2015. These are also the highest levels that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has recorded for the two metrics since 2015. Businesses are considered part of the LCREE if their activities include economic activity in one or more of 17 sectors including renewable energy and sectors likely to help the UK generate lower greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. These sectors are combined into six larger groups of similar activities. In 2021, the ‚Äúenergy efficient products‚Äù group, which includes sectors of energy efficient lighting, energy efficient products and energy monitoring, saving or control systems, had the highest turnover (¬£19.6 billion) and largest employment level (138,300 full-time equivalents) of the six groups. This group also experienced the greatest increase in turnover between 2020 and 2021, growing 27.3%. The group with the largest increase in employment was ‚Äúlow emission vehicles and infrastructure‚Äù, growing 70.6% to 36,500 full-time equivalents between 2020 and 2021.

         <title>Retail sales increased in January 2023 </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/retailsalesgreatbritainjanuary2023</link>
         <description>Retail sales increased in January 2023 17 February 2023 Retail sales picked up slightly in January after December‚Äôs steep fall. Sales volumes (the amount of stuff bought) rose by 0.5% in January 2023, following a fall of 1.2% in December 2022. The sales growth was driven by various sectors including vehicle fuel, online retail, and non-food related retail such as cosmetics stores, carpets and furnishing stores, and watches and jewellery stores. However, the uptick in sales in January comes after a gradual drop in the amount bought from retailers since summer 2021. In the three months to January 2023, sales volumes fell by 0.9% when compared with the previous three months, and were 5.7% below the same period a year earlier.

Total retail sales volumes were 1.4% below their pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels in February 2020. However, in terms of value spent, retail sales had risen 14.0% over the same period.
