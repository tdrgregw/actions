         <title>Households are still the largest contributor to UK emissions</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/ukenvironmentalaccounts2023</link>
         <description>Households are still the largest contributor to UK emissions 5 June 2023 UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a residence basis ‚Äì a different measure from the territorial measure often used relating to UK residents and UK-registered businesses, regardless of whether they are in the UK or overseas ‚Äì increased by 3% between 2020 and 2021, to just over 502 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt Co2e). Households, through consumer expenditure, are the largest single contributor to UK emissions. In 2021, emissions related to consumer expenditure ‚Äì primarily from heating homes and travelling ‚Äì reached 26% of the total. The second-highest emitter was the energy sector, at 17% of the total. The transport sector‚Äôs emissions reduced by 9% in 2021 following a 28% fall in 2020; the largest decrease (34%) of all sectors since 2019. Households remain the highest contributors to overall UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 Trend for Greenhouse gas emissions for the three highest-emitting industries, and households, UK, 1990 to 2021 Source: UK Environmental Accounts from the Office for National Statistics Download this chart Households remain the highest contributors to overall UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 Image .csv .xls A reduction in overall UK GHG emission intensity would in theory indicate that the UK is moving towards a lower carbon economy. In 2021, the UK emitted 0.19 thousand tonnes of CO2e per ¬£ million of gross value added (GVA) on a residence basis: a drop of 67% since 1990. Agriculture, forestry and fishing was the most emission-intensive industry in 2021 after surpassing electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply in 2016. This is likely a combination of the agriculture industry being the heaviest emitter of methane, a potent GHG, and the reduction in emission intensity from the electricity industry. Most GHG emissions are related to energy use. The UK used a total of almost 176 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) of energy in 2021, with 80% coming from fossil fuels. Energy from renewable sources accounted for 13% of all energy use in the UK in 2021, compared with 0.9% in 1990. The environmental goods and services sector (EGSS) statistics measure 17 activities across the economy that produce goods and services for environmental protection and resource management purposes.

         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/economicactivityandsocialchangeintheukrealtimeindicators8june2023</link>
         <description>UK payment card spending rises alongside retail footfall 8 June 2023 Credit and debit card spending rose in three out of four categories during May 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics‚Äô (ONS) monthly Clearing House Automated Payment System-based (CHAPS) indicator. Monthly ‚Äúdelayable‚Äù spending increased the most, by 6 percentage points, while ‚Äústaple‚Äù spending decreased by 1 percentage point when compared with April 2023. However, when compared with the previous year, ‚Äústaple‚Äù spending in May 2023 was 12 percentage points higher than May 2022, while ‚Äúdelayable‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial‚Äù spending were 3 and 2 percentage points lower, respectively. Revolut debit card data showed an increase in consumer spending, with overall spending up by 6 percentage points in the week to 4 June 2023. This represented an increase of 15 percentage points on the equivalent week in 2022. For the second week in a row, spending increased across all categories last week, with ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù and ‚Äúretail‚Äù categories seeing the largest rises of 13 and 7 percentage points, respectively. Spending also rose across two-thirds of all categories, compared with the equivalent period in 2022. ‚ÄúRetail‚Äù spending saw the largest increase of 32 percentage points, however spending on ‚Äúpubs, restaurants, and fast food‚Äù dropped by 8 percentage points. Retail footfall increased in two-thirds of the 12 English regions and UK countries in the week to 4 June 2023, according to the latest data from Springboard. Northern Ireland and the Southwest were joint highest, at 107% of the level of the previous week, whereas London and the Northeast both decreased and were at 98% of the level of the previous week.

         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/businessinsightsandimpactontheukeconomy8june2023</link>
         <description>Small signs of improvement for businesses 8 June 2023 While business conditions remain challenging, there have been some small signs of improvement according to our latest Business Insights and Conditions Survey . When asked in May 2023, 68% of businesses reported they had some form of concern for June 2023. This was down from 71% for May 2023, and the lowest percentage reported this year. There were fewer businesses with primary concerns about prices and inflation. Those reporting energy prices as their main concern fell from 18% for May 2023 to 15% for June 2023, and those whose main concern was inflation of goods and services prices fell from 16% to 15%. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of trading businesses were able to get the materials, goods or services they need from within the UK in April 2023, which was stable from the previous month. A similar proportion (63%) were not experiencing worker shortages in late May 2023, stable with late April 2023.

         <title>Real earnings are still falling</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/latest</link>
         <description>Real earnings are still falling 13 June 2023 Average pay for UK employees rose in February to April 2023 compared with the previous year. However, after taking into account inflation (rising prices), pay actually fell in real terms. According to new labour market data, average total pay for employees (which includes bonuses) rose by 6.5% in February to April 2023, and average regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 7.2%. This is the largest growth rate seen outside of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. After adjusting for inflation, real-terms total pay fell by 2.0%, and real-terms regular pay fell by 1.3%. The UK employment rate rose by 0.2 percentage points, to 76.0% in February to April 2023, with the number of people in employment reaching a record high. The unemployment rate also increased by 0.1 percentage point, to 3.8%. The economic inactivity rate (those not in work and not looking for work) fell by 0.4 percentage points, to 21.0%. This was largely driven by a decrease in those who were inactive for ‚Äúother reasons‚Äù or because they were looking after family or the home. Economic inactivity because of long-term sickness remained at a record high. The number of job vacancies in the UK fell by 79,000 on the quarter in March to May 2023, to 1.051 million. This was the eleventh consecutive quarterly fall in vacancies, with survey respondents continuing to cite economic pressures as a factor holding back recruitment.

         <title>UK GDP estimated to have grown by 0.2% in April 2023 </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/uktradeapril2023</link>
         <description>UK GDP estimated to have grown by 0.2% in April 2023 14 June 2023 Monthly real gross domestic product (GDP), which is the total value of goods and services produced after adjusting for inflation, is estimated to have grown by 0.2% in April 2023 after a fall of 0.3% in March. Looking at the broader picture, GDP grew by 0.1% in the three months to April 2023 compared with the three months to January 2023. Services grew by 0.3% in April 2023, after falling by 0.5% in March 2023, and was the main contributor to the growth. The largest contributions to the growth in services came from the ‚Äúwholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles‚Äù and ‚Äúinformation and communication‚Äù sectors. Production output fell by 0.3% in April 2023, following growth of 0.7% in March 2023. Manufacturing was the largest contributor to the fall within the production sector. Construction saw a 0.6% fall in April 2023, following growth of 0.2% in March 2023. Growth in the services sector was slightly offset by falls in production and construction in April 2023 Contributions to monthly GDP growth, April 2022 to April 2023, UK Source: GDP monthly estimate from the Office for National Statistics.

The total value of goods imported to the UK decreased by ¬£14.1 billion (8.8%) and imports of services decreased by an estimated ¬£2.2 billion (3.3%) in the three months to April 2023. Over the same period, the total value of goods exports from the UK decreased by ¬£3.3 billion (3.4%), while exports of services fell by ¬£0.3 billion (0.3%). The larger fall in imports meant that the total trade in goods and services deficit, the amount by which the cost of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports, narrowed to ¬£12.3 billion over the three months.

         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/publicopinionsandsocialtrendsgreatbritain31mayto11june2023</link>
         <description>Price of food increases cost of living 16 June 2023 The cost of living remains the most pressing issue for people in Great Britain, according to our latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. Around 9 in 10 people (91%) who were asked about the most important issues facing the UK today cited the cost of living, when asked between 1 and 11 June 2023. Around 6 in 10 (62%) adults reported that their cost of living had increased, compared with a month ago; this proportion appears to have gradually decreased since early April 2023, when it was at 76%. Commonly reported reasons why adults said their cost of living had increased compared with a month ago were; an increase in the price of food shopping (97%), an increase in gas or electricity bills (64%), an increase in the price of fuel (39%), or an increase in their rent or mortgage costs (23%).
