         <description>Half of British adults worried about cost of energy and food 21 April 2023 Around half of British adults say they have worried about the cost of energy and food in recent weeks. That is according to our latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which asked people what issues they had worried about in the past fortnight. The most-reported problems were the cost of energy (49%) and cost of food (49%), according to responses collected between 5 and 16 April 2023. People living in the most-deprived areas in England were more likely to report such concerns. Among those living in the most-deprived fifth of areas in England, 64% said they had been worried about the cost of food and 60% about the cost of energy. This was compared with 40% and 42%, respectively, in the least-deprived fifth of areas in the country. Estimates by deprivation are provided for England only. This is because of the smaller sample sizes from the survey in Scotland and Wales. The cost of energy and food are the most common concerns Proportion of all adults in Great Britain, 5 to 16 April 2023 Source: Opinions and Lifestyle Survey from the Office for National Statistics Notes: Question: &quot; Which of the following issues, if any, have you been worried about in the past two weeks?&quot;. Base: all adults. Respondents were able to choose more than one option. 15% of adults reported that they have not been worried about any issues in the past two weeks. This has not been included in the chart because respondents who selected this response option were unable to select any other response option.

         <title>1 in 20 adults running out of food</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/trackingtheimpactofwinterpressuresingreatbritain</link>
         <description>1 in 20 adults running out of food 24 April 2023 In February 2023, 5% of people said they had run out of food and been unable to afford more in the past two weeks. In November 2022 to January 2023, and in February 2023, we surveyed adults in Great Britain about their experiences of affording food over winter. New analysis looks at how many people struggled with these issues across both survey periods, and how many reported struggling for part of the winter but not the other. The 5% of adults who reported running out of food in February 2023. This comprised 3% who persistently reported this across both survey periods, and 2% who did not report this previously but did in the latest period. Running out of food was more common for people in certain groups. One in five (20%) people experiencing moderate to severe depressive symptoms said they had run out of food in the latest period. This comprised 13% who reported this persistently across both survey periods, and 6% who did not report this issue in the previous period but did in the latest (these figures do not sum to 20% because of rounding). The following groups appeared more likely to persistently report running out of food and being unable to buy more: those not in work, not seeking work and not retired (10%) those living in the most deprived areas of England (8%) disabled people (6%) You can explore further how different groups have been affected by a range of issues over time in the full article.

         <title>Annual public sector borrowing below official forecast</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/latest</link>
         <description>Annual public sector borrowing below official forecast 25 April 2023 In March 2023, the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income, requiring it to borrow ¬£21.5 billion. Combined with a reduction of ¬£14.6 billion to our previously published financial year-to-February borrowing figure, this brings the initial estimate for borrowing in the financial year ending (FYE) 2023 to ¬£139.2 billion. This was the fourth highest financial year borrowing on record, behind FYE 2021 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and both FYE 2010 and FYE 2011 (after the effects of the global financial downturn). The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicts final public sector borrowing in the FYE 2023 will be ¬£13.2 billion higher than our initial estimate, at ¬£152.4 billion. Debt at the end of March was ¬£2,530.4 billion, ¬£16.0 billion less than forecast by the OBR. This was equivalent to 99.6% of the UK‚Äôs annual gross domestic product (GDP), 1.0 percentage point lower than forecast. Debt is only one of several measures of the public sector balance sheet. This month we expanded our balance sheet presentation to include public sector net worth, which we explain in our blog What the UK government owns and what it owes .

This was followed by: ‚Äúother‚Äù conditions at 23.8% musculoskeletal problems at 10.5% respiratory conditions at 8.3% mental health conditions at 7.9% All age groups experienced increases in their sickness absence rate in 2022. Groups with the highest rates of sickness absence in 2022 included women, older workers, those with long-term health conditions, people working part-time, and people working in care, leisure, or other service occupations.

         <title>ONS launches shopping prices comparison tool</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/ukconsumerpriceinflationbasketofgoodsandservices/latest</link>
         <description>ONS launches shopping prices comparison tool 03 May 2023 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has released a new tool allowing you to compare the average prices of over 450 items in the consumer prices inflation basket. In the past year, 95% of these items have increased in price , with cucumbers (up 52%), olive oil (up 49%) and hard cheese (up 44%) seeing the largest increases. The tool contains items ranging from bananas to nursery fees and aims to help improve the accessibility of existing ONS data by easily allowing users to track average price trends. As well as showing average price changes on an item-by-item basis, the tool also lets you create your own bespoke basket of items and calculate the total average price change across these items. For example, a roast dinner for four people, including a whole chicken weighing (1.5kg), white potatoes (1kg), carrots (1 kg), broccoli (350g) and butter (100g), could cost ¬£8.68 on average in March 2023, based on a 2023 sample. This is ¬£1.68 more than in March 2022, with broccoli recording the highest increase at 34%. The tool will be updated every month to reflect the latest inflation data and will be refreshed each March to accommodate the latest changes to the items in the inflation basket . ü†ï Back to the top</description>
