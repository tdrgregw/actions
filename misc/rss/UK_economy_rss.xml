         <description>Renters more likely to be financially vulnerable 14 July 2023 Renters across Britain are nearly five (4.7) times as likely to be financially vulnerable as those who own their home outright. That was higher than people with mortgages, who on average were two (2.0) times as likely as people who own their own homes to be financially vulnerable. People aged 25 to 34 years and disabled adults also had greater odds of being financially vulnerable, according to our survey on the impact of increased cost of living covering the period 8 February to 1 May 2023 .

Some 3 in 10 (30%) reported using their savings, according to our latest Public opinions and social trends bulletin for the period 28 June to 9 July 2023. That was up from a quarter (25%) of adults who reported doing this in late April 2023. Around 6 in 10 (60%) adults said that their cost of living had increased compared with a month ago, although this proportion has gradually decreased since early April 2023. When asked about the important issues facing the UK today, people were most likely to cite the cost of living (92%), followed by the NHS (88%), the economy (79%), climate change and the environment (62%) and housing (62%).

         <title>Falling motor fuel prices help ease inflation </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/consumerpriceinflationukjune2023</link>
         <description>Falling motor fuel prices help ease inflation 19 July 2023 The rate at which prices of goods and services are rising eased to 7.3% in the year to June 2023, down from 7.9% in May. This is according to the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiersâ€™ housing costs (CPIH). It has fallen from a peak in October 2022, when the annual inflation rate stood at 9.6%, the highest in over 40 years, according to indicative modelled consumer price inflation estimates . The recent easing is mainly because of falls in petrol and diesel prices. Overall, motor fuel prices fell by 22.7% in the year to June 2023, after a fall of 13.1% in May. However, core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, remains at historic highs. Core CPIH rose by 6.4% in the year to June 2023, slightly down from 6.5% in May, which was the highest rate for more than 30 years.

         <description>House price growth slows while private rents rise at record pace 19 July 2023 Annual growth in UK house prices has continued to slow. The provisional estimate for the average price of a UK house was Â£286,000 in May 2023. This is Â£6,000 higher than in the same month a year ago, but Â£7,000 less than the recent peak in September 2022. This represents an average increase of 1.9% in the year to May 2023 (provisional), down from growth of 3.2% in the year to April 2023 (revised estimate).

         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/economicactivityandsocialchangeintheukrealtimeindicators20july2023</link>
         <description>Net 2% of firms report decreased turnover 20 July 2023 A net 2% of firms in June 2023 reported decreased turnover on the previous month after seasonal adjustment, driven by a worsening picture in the services sector. This figure was down 4 percentage points from a net 2% of firms who reported increasing turnover in May 2023, though this latest figure remains within normal month-on-month variation.â€¯This was according to data from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). A net 2% of firms reported decreasing turnover in June 2023 Weighted Value Added Tax turnover diffusion indices, UK, January 2020 to June 2023, seasonally adjusted Embed code Embed this interactive Copy The services sector saw a net 3% of firms reporting a decrease in turnover, down from a net 2% of firms who reported increasing turnover in May 2023. It is the first time more firms in the services sector have reported decreased turnover than increased turnover since September 2022. Construction and production were the only industries where more firms reported an increase in turnover than a decrease, at net 2% and 1%, respectively. Agriculture was the only sector that showed growth in the net proportion of firms reporting an increase in turnover. The sector rose 2 percentage points in June 2023 following a rise of 6 percentage points in May 2023.â€¯This was despite the agriculture sector having 3% more firms reporting a decreased turnover than reporting an increased turnover.

         <title>Debt as percentage of GDP at levels last seen in early 1960s </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/latest</link>
         <description>Debt as percentage of GDP at levels last seen in early 1960s 21 July 2023 The public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income in June 2023, requiring it to borrow Â£18.5 billion, Â£0.4 billion less than in June last year. This was the third highest June borrowing on record, behind that of both 2020 and 2022. It was Â£2.7 billion less than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). This month, higher tax receipts and a substantial fall in debt interest payable compared with June 2022 were largely offset by uprated benefit payments and other costs. The interest payable on central government debt in June was Â£12.5 billion, the third highest in any single month on record. However, it was Â£7.5 billion less than the peak of Â£20.0 billion in June 2022. Debt at the end of June 2023 was just below Â£2.6 trillion and initially estimated at 100.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). Estimates of debt as a ratio of GDP should be treated as highly provisional, and likely to be revised in future publications. The last time an estimate of the debt-to-GDP ratio remained above 100% for a sustained period was in March 1961. In our What the UK government owns and what it owes blog , we explain that debt is only one of several measures of the public sector balance sheet. Our Public sector finances, UK: May 2023 statistical bulletin places these measures in context with each other.

         <title>Summer sales lead to national shopping boost </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/retailsalesgreatbritainjune2023</link>
         <description>Summer sales lead to national shopping boost 21 July 2023 Summer sales at department stores and furniture shops have contributed to an overall boost in retail sales volumes. This is the highest monthly increase since February 2023. Sales volumes increased by an estimated 0.7% in June 2023, following a revised rise of 0.1% in May 2023. Sales volumes (how much people buy) increased across all main sectors except automotive fuel. Summer sales and increased footfall at department stores and furniture retailers pushed up non-food stores sales in June 2023. These rose by 1.0%, following a 0.5% fall in May 2023. Food stores sales volumes also bounced back, experiencing a 0.7% increase in June 2023 after a 0.4% fall in the previous month. Supermarkets reported that good weather and summer promotions helped sales. The only main sector not to experience a boost last month was automotive fuel stores, where sales volumes fell by 0.3%, compared with a rise of 1.7% in May. When compared with their pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) level in February 2020, total retail sales were 17.9% higher in value terms, but volumes were 0.2% lower.
