A fifth of adults say travel plans affected by rail strikes 13 January 2023Around 1 in 5 adults across Great Britain said their travel plans in the previous two weeks had been disrupted by rail strikes. That is according to data collected between 21 December 2022 and 8 January 2023 from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which covers the period of industrial action on the rail network in the lead-up to, and after, Christmas. The survey also reveals around 9 in 10 adults (92%) reported the cost of living as an important issue facing the UK today. More than 8 in 10 (85%) said the NHS was an important issue, up from 81% among those surveyed between 7 and 18 December 2022. That was followed by 75% who cited the economy, while 58% said climate change.

The survey also revealed around two-thirds (65%) of adults have reported they are spending less on non-essentials because of the rising cost of living, while around 4 in 10 adults (41%) reported spending less on food shopping and essentials. That was down from 46% among those asked between 22 November and 4 December 2022. However, it was still far higher than the 25% who said the same when the question was first asked between 15 December 2021 and 3 January 2022.

         <title>Real value of pay continues to fall </title>

         <description>

Real value of pay continues to fall 17 January 2023Regular pay for UK employees fell at near-record levels in the three months to November 2022 after accounting for the rising cost of living. Average regular pay (excluding bonuses) among employees grew 6.4% in September to November 2022, which is the strongest growth rate seen outside the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The private sector saw growth of 7.2%, while it rose by 3.3% in the public sector. After adjusting for inflation (the rising cost of goods and services), however, pay fell in real terms over the year by 2.6%, which is among the largest drops since records began in 2001. The number of vacancies across the UK in October to December 2022 also fell by 75,000, to 1,161,000, which survey respondents say reflects economic pressures. Although that means there have been six quarterly (three-month period) falls in a row, the number of vacancies remains at historically high levels. The redundancy rate also increased to 3.4 per 1,000 employees in September to November 2022 but remains low. Economic inactivity (people not working nor seeking work) fell very slightly in the last quarter (September to November 2022), although 21.5% of those aged 16 to 64 years in the UK were still classed as economically inactive.

         <title>Inflation continues to ease from record highs </title>

         <description>

Inflation continues to ease from record highs 18 January 2023The annual inflation rate in the UK has continued to ease from 40-year highs, driven by lower rises in motor fuel prices. This was partially offset by higher rises in prices for passenger travel, notably for air travel, which reached record highs. In the year to December 2022, the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupier‚Äôs housing costs (CPIH) rose by 9.2%, down from 9.3% in November and 9.6% in October. Indicative modelled estimates suggest that the October rate was the highest rate in over 40 years. In the most recent month however, the CPIH annual rate was equal to the rate recorded just over 30 years earlier, between September and December 1990. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 10.5% in the 12 months to December 2022, down from 10.7% in November and 11.1% in October. These falls were driven by lower inflation in transport, notably for motor fuels. The annual CPIH inflation rate for transport was 6.9% in December 2022, down for a sixth consecutive month from a peak of 15.2% in June 2022, and the lowest rate since May 2021.

The easing in motor fuels inflation in December 2022 was partially offset by annual price rises of 11.3% for passenger transport by road (largely because of coach fares) and 44.1% for passenger transport by air. The annual inflation rate for passenger transport by air of 44.1% is the largest recorded rate for this class in the national statistic series, which begins in January 2006, and in the constructed series, which begins in January 1989.

         <title>Spending on debit cards continues to fall </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/economicactivityandsocialchangeintheukrealtimeindicators19january2023</link>
         <description>

Spending on debit cards continues to fall 19 January 2023Debit card spending in the UK fell by 3 percentage points in the week to 15 January 2022, according to data from Revolut. The most notable category to see a drop in spending was ‚Äúautomotive fuel‚Äù, which saw the largest decrease of 19 percentage points. This category was 59 percentage points below the peak level reported for this category in mid-August 2022, coinciding with recent falls in the price of road fuel. Spending on ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù and ‚Äúpubs, restaurants and fast food‚Äù also continued to fall, decreasing by 8 percentage points and 7 percentage points, respectively, in line with usual seasonal reductions in consumer demand. However, spending in all categories was above the level reported in the equivalent period of the previous year. Spending in the ‚Äúretail‚Äù category was 38 percentage points above the equivalent level of 2022. Users should note that these data are not adjusted for the potential effects of inflation on the value of transactions.

         <title>December borrowing highest on record </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/publicsectorfinancesukdecember2022</link>
         <description>

December borrowing highest on record 24 January 2023The public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income in December 2022, requiring it to borrow ¬£27.4 billion. That was the highest December figure since monthly records began and was largely driven by a sharp rise in government spending on energy support schemes and an increase in debt interest payable. The interest payable on central government debt for the month was ¬£17.3 billion, which is the highest for December on record and the second largest in any single month behind the ¬£20.0 billion recorded in June 2022. The interest payable on central government debt increases with inflation, as a significant chunk of the debt is linked to the Retail Prices Index. That means recent substantial rises in energy prices have pushed interest costs to record levels. The ¬£27.4 billion additional borrowing in December brings the total borrowed in the financial year-to-December 2022 to ¬£128.1 billion, which was ¬£5.1 billion more than that borrowed in the same period of 2021 but ¬£2.7 billion less than the official forecast. Debt at the end of December was ¬£2.5 trillion (¬£2,503.6 billion) or 99.5% of the UK‚Äôs annual gross domestic product (GDP).

         <title>Just over a quarter of the UK workforce are night-time workers </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/exploringthenighttimeeconomy</link>
         <description>

Just over a quarter of the UK workforce are night-time workers 24 January 2023The total number of night-time workers went from 8.6 million in 2021 to 8.7 million in 2022 but has fallen from 9.5 million in 2016. Someone is deemed a night-time worker if they &quot;usually&quot; work either in the evening or the night, irrespective of whether they also &quot;usually&quot; work in the day. By this definition, 26.7% of the workforce were night-time workers in 2022, down from a maximum of 30.8% in 2014. The largest numbers of night-time workers are in the human health and social work activities sector, at 4.3% of the entire UK workforce. This is followed by accommodation and food service activities and wholesale and retail, where night-time workers make up 2.7% of all UK workers. The night-time economy relies heavily on people born outside of the UK: between 2012 and 2022, the number of night-time workers born outside of the UK rose by 32.6% to 2.0 million. In the 24-hour health and personal services grouping of industries, this number rose by 69.1% to 0.5 million.

Out-of-town employment growing fastest 24 January 2023Out-of-town areas have seen employment grow at higher rates than in towns and large cities over the last decade. Employment in out-of-town locations across England and Wales grew by 20% between 2009 and 2021, compared with 7% in towns and 14% in large cities (excluding London).

This was the case in most parts of England and Wales, with the growth rate for employment greater out of town in 140 out of 173 locations, known as Travel to Work Areas. However, the vast majority (87%) of employment growth in out-of-town locations happened within 2 kilometres of town or city boundaries, meaning it is likely to have included growth in business and retail parks. Overall, towns accounted for 52% of total employment in England and Wales in 2021, compared with 14% for out-of-town locations, 19% in London and 15% in large cities.
