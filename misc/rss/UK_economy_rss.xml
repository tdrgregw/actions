         <title>Domestic and cross-border mergers and acquisitions fall </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/mergersandacquisitionsinvolvingukcompaniesjulytoseptember2023</link>
         <description>Domestic and cross-border mergers and acquisitions fall 5 December 2023 Domestic mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) involve UK companies acquiring other UK companies. Inward M&amp;A involve foreign companies acquiring UK companies. Outward M&amp;A involve UK companies acquiring foreign companies. In Quarter 3 (Jul to Sep) 2023, the total combined number of domestic and cross-border M&amp;A transactions involving a change in majority share ownership was 362. This was 117 transactions fewer than in Quarter 2 (Apr to Jun) 2023 (479). The value of inward M&amp;A in Quarter 3 2023 was £5.4 billion, £0.7 billion higher than the previous quarter (£4.7 billion) but a sizeable £17.0 billion lower than the same quarter last year (£22.4 billion). The total value of outward M&amp;A in Quarter 3 2023 was £2.2 billion, £0.2 billion higher than in the previous quarter (£2.0 billion) but £6.1 billion lower than in Quarter 3 2022 (£8.3 billion). The value of domestic M&amp;A (UK companies acquiring other UK companies) during Quarter 3 (Jul to Sep) 2023 was £2.6 billion, a £0.2 billion decrease compared with the previous quarter (£2.8 billion) and £0.1 billion more than in Quarter 3 2022 (£2.5 billion). The data produced and published for the Mergers and Acquisitions survey involving UK companies only includes transactions that result in a change of ultimate control of the target company and have a value of £1 million or more. Read our bulletin Mergers and Acquisitions involving UK companies: July to September 2023 We advise caution when comparing results for January to June 2023 as these numbers are provisional and may be subject to revisions until early 2024. Revisions can be in either direction but historically have been more likely to be upward than downward. 🠕 Back to the top</description>

         <title>Around 4 in 10 people identified as homeless in 2021 were disabled</title>

         <description>Around 4 in 10 people identified as homeless in 2021 were disabled 6 December 2023 People identified as homeless in Census 2021 were twice as likely as the rest of the population to be disabled. Of those identified as homeless on census day (meaning those who were in hostels or homeless shelters, but not those sleeping rough), 4 in 10 (44.1%) were disabled. This compares with 17.5% of people in the wider population. People identified as homeless were also 8 years younger on average than the wider population. Females identified as homeless were on average 16 years younger than the rest of the female population. People identified as homeless were more likely than the rest of the population to hold no formal qualifications and were also disproportionately likely to identify within “Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African”, “Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups”, or “Other ethnic group”.
