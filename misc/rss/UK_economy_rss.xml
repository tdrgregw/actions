         <description>Long-term sickness pushes more people out of labour market 26 July 2023 More than 2.5 million people across the UK were neither working nor looking for work because of long-term sickness in the three months to May 2023. It means the number of working-age people out of the labour market (known as ‚Äúeconomically inactive‚Äù) has risen by more than 400,000 since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Economic inactivity linked to long-term sickness is rising Cumulative change in economic inactivity (seasonally adjusted), people aged 16 to 64 years, December to February 2020 to March to May 2023 Source: Labour Force Survey from the Office for National Statistics Download this chart Economic inactivity linked to long-term sickness is rising Image .csv .xls Overall, 36% of working-age people said that they had at least one long-term health condition between January and March 2023. This was up from 31% in the same period of 2019, and 29% in the same period of 2016. During the same period, more than 1.35 million (53%) of those inactive because of long-term sickness reported that they had depression, bad nerves or anxiety.

         <description>Business creations and closures fell compared with a year ago 27 July 2023 The number of new businesses in the UK has dropped in the space of a year. Experimental figures from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) showed that there were 77,095 businesses created between Quarter 2 (Apr to Jun) 2023 and Quarter 2 2022. This is a drop of 14% and is the second lowest number of business creations in a second quarter since the start of this series in 2017. The number of business creations decreased in 14 out of 16 industry groups this quarter when compared with Quarter 2 2022. The most significant decrease came in the transport and storage industry, where business creations were down by 59%. The number of business closures in the UK in Quarter 2 2023 was 84,150. This is 15% lower than in Quarter 2 2022. The number of business closures decreased in 14 out of 16 main industrial groups. The most significant decrease in closures came in the professional, scientific and technical industry (down 25%). This is now the eighth quarter in a row where there have been more closures than creations. The statistics presented are Experimental Statistics , so care needs to be taken when interpreting them.

In Wales, the average house price was 6.4 times the average income. In Scotland, it was 5.3 times the average income and in Northern Ireland it was 5.1 times the average income. For households with the lowest incomes, the average home in England cost 19 years of income.

         <title>Two-fifths struggling with rent or mortgage </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/publicopinionsandsocialtrendsgreatbritain12to23july2023</link>
         <description>Two-fifths struggling with rent or mortgage 28 July 2023 Some 4 in 10 renters or mortgage holders (40%) across Britain are finding it difficult to afford their payments. That is according to our latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey for the period 12 to 23 July 2023. The figure has increased from around 3 in 10 (31%) in July 2022. Among those currently paying rent or a mortgage, over 4 in 10 (45%) reported that their rent or mortgage payments had gone up in the past six months. Overall, around 6 in 10 adults (59%) reported that their cost of living had increased when compared with a month ago. However, this proportion appears to have gradually dropped since early April 2023, when it was at 76%.

         <title>Most businesses have not assessed key climate change risks</title>

         <description>Most businesses have not assessed key climate change risks 10 August 2023 Three-quarters (75%) of UK businesses in our latest business insights survey said that they had not assessed the risks of certain climate change effects. These effects included water scarcity, coastal erosion, increased flooding and temperature increases. Our Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) for late July 2023 does not cover all sectors of the economy so the results reflect only those surveyed. Of those businesses that had assessed these risks of climate change, 28% had not taken any action, 18% did not expect to be impacted, while 18% reported they had been unable to take action, either due to costs or the lack of information or guidance. Our survey also showed that in late July 2023, 21% of businesses reported that they were using, or intending to use, increased homeworking as a permanent business model, with reduced overheads (51%) and improved staff well-being (47%) reported as the main reasons.
