         <title>Overall inflation eases but food prices still rising sharply</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/consumerpriceinflationukmarch2023</link>
         <description>Overall inflation eases but food prices still rising sharply 19 April 2023 Changes in the cost of motor fuels helped slow the overall rate of rising prices paid by UK consumers for goods and services in the 12 months to March 2023. However, the price of food and drink as well as gas and electricity continued to increase at historic rates. As measured by the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH), the annual inflation rate fell slightly to 8.9% in March 2023. That was a slightly lower rate of increase compared with the 9.2% rise recorded in the 12 months to February 2023, but was still high compared with recent years. One of the main factors behind the slowing annual inflation rate was a drop in the price of motor fuels, which fell by 5.9% in the year to March 2023, compared with a rise of 4.6% in February. Despite the slowing of the overall annual rate, food and non-alcoholic drink prices still rose by 19.2% in the year to March 2023, up from 18.2% in February. The latest figure is the highest increase observed for over 45 years. Electricity and gas prices also rose by 66.7% and 129.4%, respectively, in the year to March 2023 (unchanged from February). These prices were also among the main drivers of inflation. Read our latest Consumer Price Inflation bulletin 🠕 Back to the top</description>

         <description>Business conditions remain challenging but signs of improvement 20 April 2023 Business conditions remain difficult but the proportion of UK businesses reporting higher prices when purchasing goods and services continued to fall in March 2023. Almost two in five (38%) trading businesses reported an increase in the prices of goods or services bought in March 2023 compared with February 2023. However, the proportion of businesses reporting higher prices compared with the previous month has steadily fallen from a peak of 48% in September 2022. These estimates from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey show small signs of positive improvement, but it is too early to know if this is the start of a longer-term change in conditions. When asked in early April 2023, nearly a quarter (23%) of trading businesses reported they expect to raise their prices in May 2023, while more than half (53%) expect the prices of goods or services they sell to stay the same. In early April 2023, more than half (53%) of businesses with 10 or more employees reported their staffing costs had increased in the last three months; in comparison, 58% reported they expect their staffing costs to increase over the next three months, higher than the 52% of businesses that expected higher costs when asked in early January 2023.

The average proportion of gross income spent on rent in the UK was 26.8% in March 2023, a ratio comparable with March 2022. This figure shows that there has been an increase of 1.8 percentage points in the average proportion of gross income spent on rent since 2019. The proportion of income spent on rent in March 2023 remained broadly stable, increasing by 0.2 percentage points when compared with March 2022 Median percentage of gross income spent on rent, UK, January 2019 to March 2023 Source: Dataloft Rental Market Analytics Download this chart The proportion of income spent on rent in March 2023 remained broadly stable, increasing by 0.2 percentage points when compared with March 2022 Image .csv .xls This new indicator uses data from Dataloft. They are a housing market economics consultancy that hold the UK’s largest dataset of rents achieved and renter demographics, covering around 40% of all private rentals in the UK. An affordability ratio is a measure of how much of their income a renter spends on their rent. If the percentage increases, it reflects a worsening of affordability.

         <title>Half of British adults worried about cost of energy and food </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/retailsalesgreatbritainmarch2023</link>
         <description>Half of British adults worried about cost of energy and food 21 April 2023 Around half of British adults say they have worried about the cost of energy and food in recent weeks. That is according to our latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which asked people what issues they had worried about in the past fortnight. The most-reported problems were the cost of energy (49%) and cost of food (49%), according to responses collected between 5 and 16 April 2023. People living in the most-deprived areas in England were more likely to report such concerns. Among those living in the most-deprived fifth of areas in England, 64% said they had been worried about the cost of food and 60% about the cost of energy. This was compared with 40% and 42%, respectively, in the least-deprived fifth of areas in the country. Estimates by deprivation are provided for England only. This is because of the smaller sample sizes from the survey in Scotland and Wales. The cost of energy and food are the most common concerns Proportion of all adults in Great Britain, 5 to 16 April 2023 Source: Opinions and Lifestyle Survey from the Office for National Statistics Notes: Question: &quot; Which of the following issues, if any, have you been worried about in the past two weeks?&quot;. Base: all adults. Respondents were able to choose more than one option. 15% of adults reported that they have not been worried about any issues in the past two weeks. This has not been included in the chart because respondents who selected this response option were unable to select any other response option.

The retail sales volume fall follows a rise of 1.1% in February 2023 and 1.2% in January, meaning that the broader picture shows sales volumes rising by 0.6% in the three months to March 2023 when compared with the three previous months. This has been the first three-month on three-month rise since August 2021. Non-food store sales volumes fell by 1.3% in March 2023, following a rise of 2.4% in February. Food store sales volumes fell by 0.7% in March 2023, following a rise of 0.6% in February 2023. Non-store retailing, the majority of which are online stores, saw sales volumes fall by 0.8% in March 2023, which followed a rise of 0.3% in February 2023. Meanwhile, automotive fuel sales volumes rose by 0.2% in March 2023 following a fall of 1.2% in February 2023. Fuel sales remain at 8.5% below their pre coronavirus (COVID-19) February 2020 levels.

         <title>1 in 20 adults running out of food</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/trackingtheimpactofwinterpressuresingreatbritain</link>
         <description>1 in 20 adults running out of food 24 April 2023 In February 2023, 5% of people said they had run out of food and been unable to afford more in the past two weeks. In November 2022 to January 2023, and in February 2023, we surveyed adults in Great Britain about their experiences of affording food over winter. New analysis looks at how many people struggled with these issues across both survey periods, and how many reported struggling for part of the winter but not the other. The 5% of adults who reported running out of food in February 2023. This comprised 3% who persistently reported this across both survey periods, and 2% who did not report this previously but did in the latest period. Running out of food was more common for people in certain groups. One in five (20%) people experiencing moderate to severe depressive symptoms said they had run out of food in the latest period. This comprised 13% who reported this persistently across both survey periods, and 6% who did not report this issue in the previous period but did in the latest (these figures do not sum to 20% because of rounding). The following groups appeared more likely to persistently report running out of food and being unable to buy more: those not in work, not seeking work and not retired (10%) those living in the most deprived areas of England (8%) disabled people (6%) You can explore further how different groups have been affected by a range of issues over time in the full article.

         <title>Annual public sector borrowing below official forecast</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/latest</link>
         <description>Annual public sector borrowing below official forecast 25 April 2023 In March 2023, the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income, requiring it to borrow £21.5 billion. Combined with a reduction of £14.6 billion to our previously published financial year-to-February borrowing figure, this brings the initial estimate for borrowing in the financial year ending (FYE) 2023 to £139.2 billion. This was the fourth highest financial year borrowing on record, behind FYE 2021 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and both FYE 2010 and FYE 2011 (after the effects of the global financial downturn). The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicts final public sector borrowing in the FYE 2023 will be £13.2 billion higher than our initial estimate, at £152.4 billion. Debt at the end of March was £2,530.4 billion, £16.0 billion less than forecast by the OBR. This was equivalent to 99.6% of the UK’s annual gross domestic product (GDP), 1.0 percentage point lower than forecast. Debt is only one of several measures of the public sector balance sheet. This month we expanded our balance sheet presentation to include public sector net worth, which we explain in our blog What the UK government owns and what it owes .

         <description>Sickness absence rate highest since 2004 26 April 2023 The UK sickness absence rate – the percentage of working hours lost because of sickness or injury – rose to 2.6% in 2022, an increase of 0.4 percentage points from 2021 and the highest it has been since 2004, when it was 2.7%. The sickness absence rate rose to 2.6% in 2022 Sickness absence rate, for all people in employment aged 16 years and over, UK, 1995 to 2022 Source: Labour Force Survey from the Office for National Statistics Download this chart The sickness absence rate rose to 2.6% in 2022 Image .csv .xls There were an estimated 185.6 million working days lost because of sickness or injury in 2022, a new record high. This represents an increase of 35.8 million from 2021 and 47.4 million more than the 2019 (pre-coronavirus pandemic) level. While the number of working days lost was a record high in 2022, days lost per worker was not, as the total number of workers in the UK has risen since the 1990s. Minor illnesses were the most common reason given for sickness absence in 2022, accounting for 29.3% of absences. This was followed by: “other” conditions at 23.8% musculoskeletal problems at 10.5% respiratory conditions at 8.3% mental health conditions at 7.9% All age groups experienced increases in their sickness absence rate in 2022. Groups with the highest rates of sickness absence in 2022 included women, older workers, those with long-term health conditions, people working part-time, and people working in care, leisure, or other service occupations.
