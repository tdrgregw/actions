Fifth of adults affected by rail strikes27 January 2023Around one in five adults in Great Britain (19%) say their travel plans had been disrupted by rail strikes in recent weeks. That is according to survey data collected between 11 and 22 January 2023, which show a similar proportion (18%) said the same in the previous survey period covering Christmas and New Year. Data collected between 7 to 18 December 2022 also show that 31% of working adults with children in school said they would have to work fewer hours if schools closed because of strike action, while 28% said that they would not be able to work. However, 41% said their work would not be affected. In the latest survey period, more than 9 in 10 adults (93%) said the cost of living is an important issue facing the UK.

One in seven worried about running out of food 30 January 2023Around one in seven adults (15%) in Great Britain had been somewhat or very worried that their food would run out before they had money to buy more in the past two weeks. This is according to our article on the impact of winter pressures on different population groups in Great Britain. This rose to one in four (25%) adults with dependent children, and 29% of adults living in the most deprived areas in England. Worry about running out of food was also more common among those of Asian (or Asian British) ethnicity (26%), those of ‚ÄúOther ethnic group‚Äù (46%), and those experiencing moderate to severe depressive symptoms (37%).

Cost of living could be pushing up UK residents‚Äô spending abroad31 January 2023People are taking fewer trips abroad compared with before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, but the total amount spent overseas is almost as high.UK residents made 24.9 million visits abroad between July and September 2022, the latest estimates from our International Passenger Survey (IPS) show.That was around triple the 8.1 million visits during the same period of 2021, although the earlier figure excludes data on Eurotunnel travel because of pandemic-related restrictions on interviews.However, it was still 17% below the 30.0 million visits between July and September 2019, before the pandemic affected international travel.While the estimated number of visits abroad was still well below pre-pandemic levels, the amount spent was similar.UK residents spent ¬£22.1 billion during visits abroad between July and September 2022, which was close to the ¬£21.9 billion spent during the same period in 2019. This could be an indication of the increased cost of living globally.A similar pattern was seen with overseas residents‚Äô visits to the UK. The 10.0 million visits made between July and September 2022 were down 16% from 11.9 million during the same period in 2019. Meanwhile, spending was similar for both periods, at ¬£9.2 billion and ¬£9.1 billion, respectively.

         <title>Largest negative terms-of-trade effect since 1970s</title>

Largest negative terms-of-trade effect since 1970s8 February 2023The impact of higher energy and commodity prices on the UK economy has lowered our terms of trade. This has reduced the UK‚Äôs purchasing power ‚Äî it can import fewer goods and services given the same level of exports. The consequences of this terms-of-trade effect is an unavoidable hit to UK real gross domestic income (GDI). The size and persistence of this effect will depend on how import and export prices evolve over the coming years, and how much of a net energy importer the UK continues to be. Real gross domestic income contracted by 0.2% in the year to Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2022. Many European countries have experienced a negative terms of trade effect as net energy importers. Italy, Germany and Japan are the G7 countries that have experienced a larger negative terms-of-trade effect than the UK over the last year. However, Norway saw the largest positive purchasing power effect among the OECD countries, while Canada and the Unites States are the only G7 countries to have had a positive terms-of-trade effect over the last year. This reflects how these countries are net energy exporters. 

The UK is currently experiencing its largest negative terms-of-trade effect since the mid-1970s

Notes:

We look at the 4-quarter change in real GDP and real GDI as a proxy of the underlying trend.
Positive values indicate a positive welfare effect, where the change in real GDI is higher than the change in real GDP. Negative values indicate a negative welfare effect, where the change in real GDI is lower than the change in real GDP.

         <title>Energy prices are main concern of one in five businesses</title>

Energy prices are main concern of one in five businesses9 February 2023Nearly one in five (19%) businesses reported energy prices were their main concern for February 2023, when asked between 23 January and 5 February 2023. This was followed by inflation of goods and services prices (16%) and falling demand for goods and services (13%). In late January 2023, nearly two in five (37%) businesses had taken some form of action to reduce their energy costs in the last three months, with 23% of those businesses reporting they had switched electrical equipment off or on standby more than usual when not in use. Of the 45% of businesses that were not planning to reduce their energy costs in the next three months, 60% said their business‚Äôs energy efficiency had already been optimised.

Spending up in pubs and restaurants in early February9 February 2023Debit card spending in pubs and restaurants and on fast food rose above levels recorded before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the week to 5 February 2023.That was the first increase above the pre-pandemic baseline (the average for February 2020) since early December 2022, according to data collected by financial technology company Revolut.Debit card spending also rose in all categories monitored by the company when compared with the equivalent week of 2022. Spending was 47 percentage points higher on retail, and 39 percentage points greater for vehicle fuel.It is important to note that the figures are not adjusted for the potential effects of inflation (the rising price of goods and services) on the value of transactions.A separate indicator of debit and credit card spending, known as the CHAPS monthly index, shows that work-related spending (including on road fuel) in January 2023 was 15 percentage points higher than a year earlier.That was the largest increase of any category and was followed by ‚Äúsocial‚Äù and ‚Äústaple‚Äù spending, which both increased by 11 percentage points.Figures from job search engine Adzuna show that the number of online job adverts on 3 February 2023 was 21% lower than the number seen a year earlier.
