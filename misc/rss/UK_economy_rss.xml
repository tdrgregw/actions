Of the total number of NEETs, 416,000 were men and 372,000 were women. There has also been an increase in the number of young people who were NEET and unemployed.

Energy prices remain the top reason trading businesses are considering doing so, with 35% citing this reason.

         <title>Students hit by rising cost of living</title>

         <description>Students hit by rising cost of living 24 February 2023 More than 9 in 10 university students in England say their cost of living has risen over the last year, with many worried it will negatively affect their studies. Some 92% of higher education students said their cost of living had increased compared with last year, according to a survey carried out between 30 January and 13 February 2023. Around half (49%) felt they had financial difficulties, with 33% saying these were minor and 16% saying they had major money problems. The survey data suggest this may be leading to higher debt levels, with 3 in 10 students (30%) saying they had taken on new debt in response to rising living costs, up from 25% in early November 2022. Of those, 71% said this was because their student loan did not cover their living costs. More than three-quarters (78%) of students were concerned that rising prices may affect how well they do in their studies, while more than a third (35%) reported they are now less likely to do further study after finishing their course. This could be affecting studentsâ€™ mental health, with around 46% reporting their mental health and well-being had worsened since the start of the Autumn term 2022.

         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/trackingtheimpactofwinterpressuresingreatbritain18to29january2023</link>
         <description>Around 1 in 11 adults report running out of food 27 February 2023 Adults across Britain are experiencing food insecurity and are having to cut down on portion sizes or skip meals altogether. Around 1 in 11 adults (9%) reported they had often or sometimes run out of food and could not afford to buy more in the past month. That is according to figures from our Winter Survey tracking the impact of winter pressures, which were collected from 18 to 29 January 2023. Around one in eight (13%) said they had cut down on meal sizes or skipped meals altogether in the past month because there was not enough money for food. Of those, 21% reported having done so on more than 14 days in the month. The survey also shows that nearly one in five adults (18%) waiting for NHS treatment say they had an appointment cancelled or delayed in the past month. Around 3 in 10 (31%) employed or self-employed adults who were waiting for NHS treatment said it had affected their work. Reasons their work was affected that they cited included having to change working tasks, not going for promotion or training opportunities, and finding new employment.

         <title>Record growth in prices food and drink manufacturers charged in January 2023 </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/recenttrendsinukfoodanddrinkproducerandconsumerprices/january2023</link>
         <description>Record growth in prices food and drink manufacturers charged in January 2023 8 March 2023 The prices UK food and drinks manufacturers charged for their products rose 17.1% in the year to January 2023, the highest annual rate on record. The prices manufacturers paid for their materials and fuels rose 19.8% in the year to January 2023. This is a slight decrease from a peak of 22.7% in the year to October 2022. This reflects rising prices of commodities worldwide, which have been affected by rising energy prices, supply chain disruption following the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Global prices of natural gas, food and fertilisers have all seen rapid increases during 2021 and 2022. The prices food and drink manufacturers charge to their customers are different to the prices consumers pay in shops and supermarkets. Consumer prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks rose 16.8% in the year to January 2023. The chart compares the increase in prices manufacturers charged for different food and drink items, and the prices retailers charged. There is a positive association between the food and drink prices charged by manufacturers and paid by consumers. Dairy products, such as milk and cheese, saw some of the largest price increases both among manufacturers and retailers.

         <title>2.5 million working days lost to strikes in late 2022 </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/theimpactofstrikesintheukjune2022tofebruary2023</link>
         <description>2.5 million working days lost to strikes in late 2022 8 March 2023 An estimated 2.5 million working days were lost because of industrial disputes between June and December 2022. Of these, almost 2 million (79%) were among workers in transport, storage, information and communication. This includes both railway workers and postal workers, both of which went on strike in this period. The second highest number of days lost between June and December 2022 was in education (226,000), with 174,000 working days lost during strikes in November 2022. There is some evidence of strikes having an impact on output in the affected industries. Rail and postal workers held several strike days in December 2022; this month also saw the largest falls in output for these industries. In December 2022, rail transport output fell 7.0%, and postal and courier activities fell 10.5%.

         <title>Mortgage Calculator shows rising monthly repayment costs </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/howaremonthlymortgagerepaymentschangingingreatbritain/2023-03-08</link>
         <description>Mortgage Calculator shows rising monthly repayment costs 8 March 2023 The monthly cost of a new mortgage rose by 61% in the year to December 2022 for the average semi-detached house in the UK. Our new personalised Mortgage Calculator , based on our House Price Index (HPI), shows how rising interest rates have caused monthly mortgage payments to rise sharply in England, Scotland and Wales. Because mortgage loans tend to be for large amounts of money, small increases in mortgage rates can have a big impact on the amount that households will have to pay back each month. Based on a 75% loan-to-value ratio, the average mortgage rate offered by lenders on a five-year fixed rate loan was 5.05% in December 2022, according to the Bank of England . That figure was up from 1.59% in December 2021. At a 75% loan-to-value rate, the average monthly mortgage repayment on a 25-year term for a semi-detached UK property was Â£1,262 in December 2022. This was a Â£481 (61%) increase on December 2021. Other property types have also experienced similar changes between December 2021 and December 2022. The monthly mortgage repayments on an average detached UK property rose by 60.7% to Â£2,041. The repayments on an average terraced UK property increased by 59.6% to Â£1,063 per month, while flats and maisonettes experienced a 54.6% rise to Â£1,028 per month.
