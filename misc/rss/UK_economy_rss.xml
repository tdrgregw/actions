         <title>Spending on debit cards continues to fall </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/economicactivityandsocialchangeintheukrealtimeindicators19january2023</link>
         <description>

Spending on debit cards continues to fall 19 January 2023Debit card spending in the UK fell by 3 percentage points in the week to 15 January 2022, according to data from Revolut. The most notable category to see a drop in spending was ‚Äúautomotive fuel‚Äù, which saw the largest decrease of 19 percentage points. This category was 59 percentage points below the peak level reported for this category in mid-August 2022, coinciding with recent falls in the price of road fuel. Spending on ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù and ‚Äúpubs, restaurants and fast food‚Äù also continued to fall, decreasing by 8 percentage points and 7 percentage points, respectively, in line with usual seasonal reductions in consumer demand. However, spending in all categories was above the level reported in the equivalent period of the previous year. Spending in the ‚Äúretail‚Äù category was 38 percentage points above the equivalent level of 2022. Users should note that these data are not adjusted for the potential effects of inflation on the value of transactions.

         <title>December borrowing highest on record </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/publicsectorfinancesukdecember2022</link>
         <description>

December borrowing highest on record 24 January 2023The public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income in December 2022, requiring it to borrow ¬£27.4 billion. That was the highest December figure since monthly records began and was largely driven by a sharp rise in government spending on energy support schemes and an increase in debt interest payable. The interest payable on central government debt for the month was ¬£17.3 billion, which is the highest for December on record and the second largest in any single month behind the ¬£20.0 billion recorded in June 2022. The interest payable on central government debt increases with inflation, as a significant chunk of the debt is linked to the Retail Prices Index. That means recent substantial rises in energy prices have pushed interest costs to record levels. The ¬£27.4 billion additional borrowing in December brings the total borrowed in the financial year-to-December 2022 to ¬£128.1 billion, which was ¬£5.1 billion more than that borrowed in the same period of 2021 but ¬£2.7 billion less than the official forecast. Debt at the end of December was ¬£2.5 trillion (¬£2,503.6 billion) or 99.5% of the UK‚Äôs annual gross domestic product (GDP).

         <title>Just over a quarter of the UK workforce are night-time workers </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/exploringthenighttimeeconomy</link>
         <description>

Just over a quarter of the UK workforce are night-time workers 24 January 2023The total number of night-time workers went from 8.6 million in 2021 to 8.7 million in 2022 but has fallen from 9.5 million in 2016. Someone is deemed a night-time worker if they &quot;usually&quot; work either in the evening or the night, irrespective of whether they also &quot;usually&quot; work in the day. By this definition, 26.7% of the workforce were night-time workers in 2022, down from a maximum of 30.8% in 2014. The largest numbers of night-time workers are in the human health and social work activities sector, at 4.3% of the entire UK workforce. This is followed by accommodation and food service activities and wholesale and retail, where night-time workers make up 2.7% of all UK workers. The night-time economy relies heavily on people born outside of the UK: between 2012 and 2022, the number of night-time workers born outside of the UK rose by 32.6% to 2.0 million. In the 24-hour health and personal services grouping of industries, this number rose by 69.1% to 0.5 million.

Out-of-town employment growing fastest 24 January 2023Out-of-town areas have seen employment grow at higher rates than in towns and large cities over the last decade. Employment in out-of-town locations across England and Wales grew by 20% between 2009 and 2021, compared with 7% in towns and 14% in large cities (excluding London).

This was the case in most parts of England and Wales, with the growth rate for employment greater out of town in 140 out of 173 locations, known as Travel to Work Areas. However, the vast majority (87%) of employment growth in out-of-town locations happened within 2 kilometres of town or city boundaries, meaning it is likely to have included growth in business and retail parks. Overall, towns accounted for 52% of total employment in England and Wales in 2021, compared with 14% for out-of-town locations, 19% in London and 15% in large cities.

         <title>Productivity above 2019 average in July to September 2022 </title>

         <description>

Productivity above 2019 average in July to September 2022 26 January 2023Labour productivity in the UK, measured as output per hour worked, was 1.6% higher than the 2019 (pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic) average in Quarter 3 (July to September) 2022. This growth was driven by a 1.2% fall in the number of hours worked, with output only seeing a marginal increase of 0.3%. Compared with Quarter 2 (April to June) 2022, output per hour increased by 0.1% in Quarter 3 2022. The manufacturing, construction, and administrative services industries made the biggest positive contribution to productivity growth compared with 2019. By contrast, the public services, and wholesale and retail industries negatively contributed to productivity growth. Public service productivity has remained mostly steady since spring 2021, but is still 7.4% below its pre-coronavirus levels.

Trade with Russia has plummeted following sanctions26 January 2023UK trade with Russia has fallen to historically low levels following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent Russian economic sanctions on trade from February 2022.The sanctions include bans on importing metals, fuel, wood products, high-end goods such as caviar, as well as further duties to a range of other goods.This has led to imports of goods from Russia falling to ¬£18 million in November 2022, a decrease of 98.2% compared with the monthly average from the 12 months to February 2022. Imports of fuel from Russia remain historically low with only ¬£9.2 million imported in November 2022, a fall of 98.1%.Imports of goods from Russia have decreased substantiallyImports of goods from Russia in millions, January 2021 to November 2022

The UK Government has applied a series of sanctions on imports of goods from Russia (PDF, 837KB), with the first import bans implemented on 14 April 2022.
Exports of goods to Russia have decreased to ¬£57 million, a fall of 77.4%. Exports of most commodities to Russia had decreased notably by November 2022. The largest decrease by value was seen in exports of machinery and transport equipment, which fell by ¬£127.7 million (98.5%) when compared with the 12 months to February 2022.Medicinal and pharmaceutical products, which are exempt from export bans, made up 50.9% of total exports to Russia in November 2022, up from 9.5% in the 12 months to February 2022.The economic sanctions applied by the UK Government are likely to have driven the decreases in trade with Russia. However, self-sanctioning (whereby traders voluntarily seek alternatives to trading with Russian enterprises) is also likely a factor.
