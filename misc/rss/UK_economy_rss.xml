         <title>Record high number inactive because of long term sickness </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/uklabourmarketmay2023</link>
         <description>Record high number inactive because of long term sickness 16 May 2023 Labour market data show the economic inactivity rate fell by 0.4 percentage points on the quarter, to 21.0% in January to March 2023. However, those inactive because of long term sickness reached a record high in the same period. Flows estimates show that between October to December and for January to March 2023 there has been a record high net flow of people moving out of economic inactivity. This has largely been driven by people moving from economic inactivity into employment. The UK employment rate was estimated at 75.9% in January to March 2023, with a 0.2 percentage point rise from October to December 2022. This was driven by rises in part-time employees and self-employed workers. Read our latest UK Labour Market bulletin . ü†ï Back to the top</description>

         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/economicactivityandsocialchangeintheukrealtimeindicators18may2023</link>
         <description>Consumer behaviour indicators decrease 18 May 2023 UK consumer behaviour indicator activity has decreased in the latest week, coinciding with the coronation of King Charles III and Camilla, Her Majesty the Queen. In the latest week there were notable falls in spending, potentially also driven by usual within month spending patterns. The aggregate CHAPS-based indicator of credit and debit card purchases decreased by 10 points in the week to 11 May 2023 according to data from the Bank of England. The monthly indicator in April 2023 was 1 percentage point higher than in April 2022. Of the four CHAPS spending categories, ‚Äústaple‚Äù and ‚Äúwork related‚Äù both saw an increase, at 12 and 4 percentage points. Meanwhile, ‚Äúdelayable‚Äù decreased by 9 percentage points and ‚Äúsocial‚Äù remained unchanged compared with April 2022. Revolut debit card spending decreased by 10 percentage points in the week to 14 May 2023 compared with the previous week. It was 17 percentage points higher than the equivalent period last year. Five of the six Revolut spending categories saw decreases in debit card spending when compared with the previous week. The biggest decreases were in the ‚Äúretail‚Äù and ‚Äúpubs, restaurants, and fast food‚Äù categories, decreasing 16 and 10 percentage points, respectively. Entertainment was the only category to see an increase, rising by 4 percentage points. Overall retail footfall decreased in the week to 14 May 2023 to 96% of the level of the previous week but was 101% of the level in the equivalent week last year, according to data from Springboard.

         <title>Fewer trading businesses report being affected by price rises</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/businessinsightsandimpactontheukeconomy18may2023</link>
         <description>Fewer trading businesses report being affected by price rises 18 May 2023 Business conditions continue to be affected by price rises, although there has been a steady downward trend in the number of trading businesses affected since September last year. More than a third (35%) of trading companies reported an increase in the price of goods or services bought in April 2023 compared with the previous month, according to the latest Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) . However, this has dropped by 2 percentage points compared with March 2023 and is currently at the lowest level seen since March 2022. Almost two-thirds (63%) of businesses not permanently stopped trading reported that they have been affected by general price increases, and over a third of companies saying the same about rising energy costs in April 2023. By contrast, the proportion of trading businesses who expect to raise the prices of their goods or services in June 2023 fell by 5 percentage points, dropping from 23% to 18% compared with expectations for May 2023. ü†ï Back to the top</description>

         <title>Second highest April borrowing on record</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/latest</link>
         <description>Second highest April borrowing on record 23 May 2023 In April 2023, the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income, requiring it to borrow ¬£25.6 billion, ¬£11.9 billion more than in April last year. This was the second highest April borrowing on record, behind that of April 2020, and ¬£3.1 billion more than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Borrowing in the financial year ending March 2023 (FYE 2023), remained the fourth highest in any financial year on record, after provisional estimates were revised down this month. The second provisional estimate reduced our first estimate by ¬£2.1billion to ¬£137.1 billion borrowed in the FYE 2023, largely because of new tax information. This means borrowing in the financial year to 2023 remained high, behind FYE 2021 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and both FYE 2010 and 2011 (after the effects of the global financial downturn). The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts final public sector borrowing in the FYE 2023 will be ¬£152.4 billion, ¬£15.3 billion higher than our current estimate. Debt at the end of April 2023 was ¬£2,536.9 billion or 99.2 % of the UK‚Äôs annual gross domestic product (GDP). Debt is only one of several measures of the public sector balance sheet. In April 2023 we expanded our balance sheet presentation to include Public sector net worth, which we explain in our blog What the UK government owns and what it owes .
