There has been a corresponding rise among those saying that they are finding it difficult to afford their rent or mortgage payments. In the latest period, 43% said that they were finding these payments very or somewhat difficult, up from a quarter (25%) in June 2022. Among those surveyed in the latest period, 1 in 50 (2%) said that they were behind on their rent or mortgage payments.

         <title>Output per hour worked decreased in Quarter 1 2023 </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/productivityoverviewukjanuarytomarch2023</link>
         <description>Output per hour worked decreased in Quarter 1 2023 07 July 2023 Labour productivity in the UK, measured as output per hour worked, was 0.6% below in the year to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2023 when compared with the same quarter a year ago. The decrease was driven by growth in hours worked (0.8%) being larger than growth in gross value added (GVA), which was at 0.2%. Excluding the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic period, Quarter 1 2023 saw the largest fall in output per hour worked since Quarter 1 2013. Compared with pre-pandemic levels (2019 average), output per hour worked grew 0.6% in Quarter 1 2023. This growth was driven by an increase of GVA of 0.6% since 2019. The number of hours worked remained constant over this period, with a growth of 0.0%. Other measures of productivity, such as output per worker and output per job, were 0.9% and 1.0% below their respective Quarter 1 2022 levels. This is because of higher growth in the number of workers (1.1%) and jobs (1.2%) than in GVA (0.2%). Administrative service and construction industries made the biggest upwards industry contribution to annual productivity growth (output per hour worked) as of Quarter 1 2023. In contrast, finance and insurance and real estate industries showed the biggest negative contribution to productivity growth.

         <title>Real pay continues to fall</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/june2023</link>
         <description>Real pay continues to fall 11 July 2023 Although average total pay (including bonuses) and regular pay (excluding bonuses) continued to rise compared with the previous year, real wages which are adjusted for inflation (price rises) fell over the same period. According to the latest labour market data, average total pay (including bonuses) for UK employees rose by 6.9% in March to May 2023 compared with the same period the previous year. Regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 7.3%, which was also seen last month and during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. By contrast, real terms total pay (adjusted for inflation) fell by 1.2% and regular pay dropped by 0.8% over the same period. Job vacancies also continued to fall in April to June 2023 by 85,000 to 1.034 million. The estimated number of vacancies fell on the quarter for the 12th consecutive period. The UK employment rate rose again by 0.2 percentage points to 76.0% in March to May 2023, an increase driven mainly by part-time employees. UK unemployment also increased by 0.2 percentage points to 4.0%. The economic inactivity rate (people not in work or looking for work) dropped by 0.4 percentage points, down to 20.8% during March to May 2023. This was largely driven by those who were inactive for other reasons, those looking after family or home, andâ€¯those who areâ€¯retired. Labour disputes led to around 128,000 lost working days in May 2023, fewer than half as many working days as in April 2023, and the lowest number since July 2022.

Imports from non-EU countries rose by Â£1.3 billion while imports from EU countries grew by Â£0.7 billion. After removing the effect of inflation, imports of goods increased by 5.9%.
