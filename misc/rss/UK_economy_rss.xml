Rising food prices leave most vulnerable worst off 22 December 2022The rising cost of supermarket staples is hitting low-income families the hardest, while households in the most-deprived areas are more likely to be buying less food. The price of food and non-alcoholic drink rose by 16.5% in the 12 months to November 2022, which was the largest increase for 45 years according to our UK Consumer Price Inflation data. Bread and cereals had the largest upward effect on the annual inflation rate in November compared with October.

Our research shows that the rising prices of these basic items has a greater effect on low-income households, who spend a larger proportion of their budget on food and non-alcoholic drink. More than half (51%) of British adults reported buying less when food shopping in the last two weeks, when surveyed between 22 November and 4 December 2022. Figures covering England show that 61% of adults in the most-deprived areas were buying less on their food shop, compared with 44% of people in the least-deprived areas. This could be having a knock-on effect on some people‚Äôs health. A Food Standards Agency survey found that in November 2022, 23% of participants said they had skipped a meal or cut down the size of their meals because they could not afford to buy food in the past month.

Post-Christmas retail activity rose compared with 2021 06 January 2023Retail activity fell across the UK after Christmas but was still well above the levels seen a year earlier, with Wales seeing the largest rise. Overall retail footfall in the week to 1 January 2023 fell to 84% of the level of the previous week, according to figures collected by data firm Springboard. The drop followed the busy Christmas shopping period and was in line with expected seasonal trends. Footfall in shopping centres saw the biggest decrease, at 80% of the level of the previous week. However, the level of activity was above that recorded in the same period a year earlier across all nine English regions and the three other UK nations. Wales saw the largest increase, at 121% of the level of the previous year. This coincided with national coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions.

         <title>Cost of future fixed-rate mortgages could increase </title>
         <link>/generator?uri=/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/ukeconomylatest/2021-01-25/e4dcacc8&amp;format=xls</link>
         <description>

Cost of future fixed-rate mortgages could increase 9 January 2023More than 1.4 million households in the UK are facing the prospect of interest rate rises when they renew their fixed rate mortgages in 2023. Most fixed rate mortgages in the UK (57%) coming up for renewal in 2023 were fixed at interest rates below 2%. Those trying to secure a new fixed-rate deal may have to do it at a higher rate of interest. The effective interest rate on outstanding mortgages with a fixed rate was 2.08% in November 2022, according to the Bank of England (BoE). Should the interest rate on a ¬£100,000 mortgage increase from 2% to 6%, assuming a 25-year capital and repayment mortgage, then the monthly mortgage repayment on the same mortgage would increase by ¬£220 (from ¬£424 to ¬£644). However, assuming the same increase on a ¬£300,000 mortgage, monthly repayments would rise by ¬£661 (from ¬£1,272 to ¬£1,933). The BoE's Financial Stability Report - December 2022, suggests that mortgagors on fixed rates set to expire by the end of 2023 are facing monthly repayment increases of around ¬£250 upon refinancing to a new fixed rate. 

The mortgage costs that households face depend on the amount they borrowed and the interest rate on their mortgage

Those on a variable rate mortgage, where the interest rate varies over the course of the repayment term, will have already seen higher interest rates as a result of market conditions including rises in the BoE base rate (the &quot;Bank Rate&quot;). Private renters are also facing an increase to their housing costs, with rental price growth at its highest rate in the UK since records began in 2016.

UK labour productivity 10% lower than other G7 nations in 2021 11 January 2023The UK had lower labour productivity than France, Germany and the USA during 2021, when measured as a ratio of economic output per hour worked. Comparing the gross domestic product (GDP) with an estimate of total hours worked (after considering overtime and various forms of leave), the UK had an output of ¬£46.92 in current prices for every hour worked in 2021. This was 10% lower than the overall average among Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the USA. These countries together with Japan, for which 2021 data are not available, and the UK form the G7.

The USA had the highest economic output at ¬£58.88 per hour worked during 2021, followed by Germany (¬£55.83) and France (¬£55.50). Both Italy and Canada had lower economic outputs per hour worked than the UK at ¬£45.33 and ¬£42.94, respectively. All G7 countries experienced a recovery in their output per hour worked during 2021 after productivity declined across the board during 2020, the first year of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While the UK had the largest decline in output per hour worked (12%) in 2020, the UK also experienced faster growth in this metric (22%) than any other G7 country in 2021.

Debit card spending falls, in line with seasonal patterns 12 January 2023Debit card spending fell by 7% in the latest week, with most consumer behaviour indicators falling in line with expected seasonal patterns. According to data from Revolut, all spending categories were above the level of seen in the equivalent period of 2022, with ‚Äúautomotive fuel‚Äù and ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù spending 47 percentage points and 38 percentage points higher, respectively. Spending in pubs, restaurants and fast food and entertainment decreased the most, in the latest period, falling by 25 and 14 percentage points, respectively. The automotive fuel category saw the largest increase, of three percentage points. Although spending in the entertainment category rose above the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) baseline for the first time since February 2020 in the previous week, it fell again to 12 percentage points below this level. Overall retail footfall fell to 84% of the level of the previous week, according to Springboard. These data are not adjusted for the potential effects of inflation on the value of transactions

         <title>Fuel imports from non-EU countries fell for third month in a row</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/uktradenovember2022</link>
         <description>

Fuel imports from non-EU countries fell for third month in a row13 January 2023Gas prices continued to decrease in November 2022, leading to the third consecutive month of decreases in the value of fuel imports to the UK from non-EU countries. However, the overall value of goods imports to the UK increased by ¬£1.8 billion (3.5%). Goods imports from EU countries increased by ¬£1.2 billion (4.7%) and imports from non-EU countries rose by ¬£0.6 billion (2.2%), both driven by rising imports of machinery and transport equipment. When removing the effect of inflation, total imports of goods increased by ¬£2.5 billion (6.1%) in November 2022. This was because of a ¬£1.3 billion (7.0%) increase in imports from non-EU countries, and a ¬£1.2 billion (5.3%) increase in imports from the EU. Total exports of goods increased slightly by ¬£0.2 billion (0.7%) in November 2022, with an increase in exports to non-EU countries partially offset by falling exports to the EU. The decrease in exports to the EU was driven by a ¬£0.4 billion fall in fuel exports. When removing the effect of inflation, total exports of goods increased by ¬£0.5 billion (1.7%) in November 2022. Exports to non-EU countries increased by ¬£0.6 billion (4.6%) while exports to the EU fell by ¬£0.2 billion (1.2%). The trade in goods and services deficit, excluding precious metals, narrowed by ¬£6.5 billion to ¬£20.2 billion in the three months to November 2022. This was driven by a decrease in goods imports from non-EU countries, which is linked to falling fuel prices. Imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries rose in November 2022EU and non-EU goods imports and exports, excluding precious metals, November 2019 to November 2022

A fifth of adults say travel plans affected by rail strikes 13 January 2023Around 1 in 5 adults across Great Britain said their travel plans in the previous two weeks had been disrupted by rail strikes. That is according to data collected between 21 December 2022 and 8 January 2023 from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which covers the period of industrial action on the rail network in the lead-up to, and after, Christmas. The survey also reveals around 9 in 10 adults (92%) reported the cost of living as an important issue facing the UK today. More than 8 in 10 (85%) said the NHS was an important issue, up from 81% among those surveyed between 7 and 18 December 2022. That was followed by 75% who cited the economy, while 58% said climate change.

The survey also revealed around two-thirds (65%) of adults have reported they are spending less on non-essentials because of the rising cost of living, while around 4 in 10 adults (41%) reported spending less on food shopping and essentials. That was down from 46% among those asked between 22 November and 4 December 2022. However, it was still far higher than the 25% who said the same when the question was first asked between 15 December 2021 and 3 January 2022.
