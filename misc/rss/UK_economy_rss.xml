         <title>Inflation falls to lowest rate since early 2022</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/consumerpriceinflationukjuly2023</link>
         <description>Inflation falls to lowest rate since early 2022 16 August 2023 The rate at which prices of goods and services are rising is at the lowest level since early 2022. In the year to July 2023, the inflation rate was 6.4%, down from 7.3% in June, according to the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH). This was the lowest rate since March 2022. Inflation continues a downward trend since its peak in October 2022, when the annual CPIH inflation rate was 9.6%, the highest in more than 40 years according to indicative estimates . Excluding owner occupiers’ housing costs, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) was 6.8% in the year to July 2023, down from 7.9% in June. This was the lowest since February 2022. Falling gas and electricity prices were the main reason for the inflation rate falling. Between June and July 2023, gas prices fell by 25.2%, the largest monthly fall since at least 1988. Over the 12 months to July 2023, inflation for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels was 6.8%, down from a peak of 26.7% in January 2023. The recent fall was largely because of the lowering of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) price cap in July 2023. Core inflation – which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco – remained at 6.4% in the year to July 2023. Read the full Consumer Prices Index bulletin 🠕 Back to the top</description>

         <title>Private rents rise at record pace while house price growth slows</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/indexofprivatehousingrentalprices/latest</link>
         <description>Private rents rise at record pace while house price growth slows 16 August 2023 Private rental prices paid by tenants in the UK increased by 5.3% in the year to July 2023. This is the highest annual percentage change since this UK data series began in January 2016. Private rental prices rose by 5.2% in England, 6.5% in Wales and 5.7% in Scotland in the year to July 2023. These are the highest annual changes in rental prices since records began (January 2006 for England, January 2010 for Wales, and January 2012 for Scotland). Private rental prices in London (which accounts for almost a third of UK rental expenditure) increased by 5.5% in the 12 months to July 2023, up from an increase of 5.3% in the 12 months to June 2023. This is the highest annual percentage change in London since the data series began in January 2006. Average UK house price annual inflation has continued to slow. The provisional estimate for the average price of a UK house was £288,000 in June 2023. This is £5,000 higher than the same month a year ago, but £5,000 less than the recent peak in November 2022. This represents an average increase of 1.7% in the year to June 2023 (provisional), down slightly from growth of 1.8% in the year to May 2023 (revised estimate).

In Wales, prices grew by 0.6% over the same period, while in England they rose by 1.9%. Average house prices in Northern Ireland rose by 2.7% in the year to Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2023. Of the English regions, the North East saw the highest house price inflation in the year to June 2023 (4.7%), although average house prices here remain the lowest of all English regions at £161,000. London saw the lowest annual inflation of any English region, with prices decreasing by 0.6% in the year to June 2023. This is because average house prices rose sharply in London a year ago, rising by £9,000 between May and June 2022, compared with a smaller increase of £3,000 between May and June 2023.

         <title>Services sector driving increase in business turnover </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/bulletins/economicactivityandsocialchangeintheukrealtimeindicators/latest</link>
         <description>Services sector driving increase in business turnover 17 August 2023 More firms reported increased turnover than reported decreased turnover in July 2023. This was driven by businesses in the services sector. This sector saw a net 5% of firms report an increase in turnover, up from a net 4% of businesses who reported a decrease in turnover in June 2023. The service sector was the only sector that showed growth in the net proportion of firms to report an increase in turnover in July 2023, rising 9 percentage points from June 2023. This growth is outside the normal month-on-month variation. This increase was also the largest driver of the total net 4% of firms who reported increasing turnover (seasonally adjusted) in July 2023.

         <title>Shoppers go online as wet weather dampens spending</title>

         <description>Shoppers go online as wet weather dampens spending 18 August 2023 Wet weather has resulted in a drop in retail sales as shoppers cut back on spending and turned to online stores. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff bought) in Great Britain fell by an estimated 1.2% in July 2023 following a rise of 0.6% in June 2023. Sales volumes at food stores dropped by 2.6% in July 2023. Supermarkets reported that wet weather caused a fall in clothing sales, although sales in food and drink also decreased. More people turned to online shopping in response to the rain. In total, 27.4% of the value of retail sales took place online in July 2023, the highest proportion since February 2022 (28.0%). Meanwhile, non-food stores also saw a decline in sales volumes, falling 1.7% in July 2023 following a 0.6% rise the previous month. Automotive fuel stores sales bounced back from a 0.6% fall in June 2023 to a 0.7% increase last month. When compared with their pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) level in February 2020, total retail sales were 16.4% higher in value terms, but volumes were 1.8% lower. Higher prices mean the amount people buy and how much they spend have moved apart Volume and value sales, seasonally adjusted, Great Britain, July 2019 to July 2023 Source: Office for National Statistics Download this chart Higher prices mean the amount people buy and how much they spend have moved apart Image .csv .xls Read our full Retail Sales, Great Britain: July 2023 bulletin 🠕 Back to the top</description>

         <title>Stronger than forecast GDP improves debt picture</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/latest</link>
         <description>Stronger than forecast GDP improves debt picture 22 August 2023 Public sector debt at the end of July 2023 was estimated at 98.5% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). This means that the level of debt was 1.5% less than the value of the annual output of the UK economy. This represents an increase in debt of 1.9 percentage points (ppts) of GDP compared with the same point last year but 4.0 ppts less than the level forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in March 2023. July saw upward revisions to our previous estimate of GDP, which have led to downward revisions to the debt ratio for recent months, with debt at the end of June being reduced by 1.3 ppts from 100.8% to 99.5% of GDP. This downward revision means that the last time the debt-to-GDP ratio was above 100% was at the end of the financial year ending March 1961. We recently published a blog explaining How the ONS estimates UK debt to GDP figures and its susceptibility to revision. In July 2023, the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income, requiring it to borrow £4.3 billion, which is £3.4 billion more than in July last year but £1.7 billion less than forecast by the OBR. This was the fifth highest July borrowing on record, behind that of July 2020, during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic period, and that of July 2009, 2010 and 2011, following the global economic downturn. July receipts are boosted by self-assessed income tax each year, with the £11.8 billion received this month being £2.5 billion more than in July 2022, and a July record. However, inflation continues to put upward pressure on spending, with increases in July’s interest costs, central government consumption (pay and procurement), and uprated benefit payments.

         <title>Domestic and inward mergers decreased in April to June 2023 </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/mergersandacquisitionsinvolvingukcompaniesapriltojune2023</link>
         <description>Domestic and inward mergers decreased in April to June 2023 5 September 2023 Provisional estimates for Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2023 indicate decreased numbers of domestic and inward mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), although the number of outward acquisitions increased when compared with Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2023. Domestic mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) involve UK companies acquiring other UK companies. Inward M&amp;A involve foreign companies acquiring UK companies. Outward M&amp;A involve UK companies acquiring foreign companies. In Quarter 2 2023, the total combined number of cross-border and domestic M&amp;A involving a change in majority share ownership was 450, which was 58 transactions fewer than Quarter 1 2023 (508). The value of inward M&amp;A in Quarter 2 2023 was £7.4 billion, £4.4 billion lower than the previous quarter (£11.8 billion) and £4.7 billion lower than the same quarter last year (£12.1 billion). The total value of outward M&amp;A in Quarter 2 2023 was £2.3 billion, £0.6 billion lower than in Quarter 1 2023 (£2.9 billion) and £2.4 billion lower than Quarter 2 2022 (£4.7 billion). The value of domestic M&amp;A during Quarter 2 2023 was £2.4 billion, £0.3 billion lower than Quarter 1 2023 (£2.7 billion) and £1.1 billion lower than Quarter 2 2022 (£3.5 billion). The data produced and published for the Mergers and Acquisitions Survey involving UK companies only include transactions that result in a change of ultimate control of the target company and have a value of £1 million or more. We advise caution when comparing results for January to June 2023 as these numbers are provisional and may be subject to revisions until early 2024. Revisions can be in either direction, but historically have been more likely to be upward than downward.

         <title>August bank holiday coincides with retail spending increase </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/economicactivityandsocialchangeintheukrealtimeindicators7september2023</link>
         <description>August bank holiday coincides with retail spending increase 07 September 2023 Retail debit card spending increased by 12 percentage points in the week to 3 September 2023, which included the August bank holiday. Consumer behaviour indicators showed an increase, according to data from Revolut. Higher retail spending and a 1 percentage point rise in travel and accommodation spending contributed to a rise of 1 percentage point in overall debit card spending. Travel and accommodation and retail spending increases were partially offset by four of the six sector categories showing decreased spending. “Pubs, restaurants and fast food” spending had the largest decrease of 8 percentage points, followed by “Entertainment”, which decreased by 7 percentage points. Total Revolut debit card spending was 21 percentage points above the equivalent period in 2022, with all six categories seeing increases in spending since last year. The largest increase was &quot;retail&quot;, which increased by 32 percentage points, followed by “food and drink”, which increased by 28 percentage points when compared with the equivalent period in 2022.
