One in seven worried about running out of food 30 January 2023Around one in seven adults (15%) in Great Britain had been somewhat or very worried that their food would run out before they had money to buy more in the past two weeks. This is according to our article on the impact of winter pressures on different population groups in Great Britain. This rose to one in four (25%) adults with dependent children, and 29% of adults living in the most deprived areas in England. Worry about running out of food was also more common among those of Asian (or Asian British) ethnicity (26%), those of ‚ÄúOther ethnic group‚Äù (46%), and those experiencing moderate to severe depressive symptoms (37%).

Cost of living could be pushing up UK residents‚Äô spending abroad31 January 2023People are taking fewer trips abroad compared with before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, but the total amount spent overseas is almost as high.UK residents made 24.9 million visits abroad between July and September 2022, the latest estimates from our International Passenger Survey (IPS) show.That was around triple the 8.1 million visits during the same period of 2021, although the earlier figure excludes data on Eurotunnel travel because of pandemic-related restrictions on interviews.However, it was still 17% below the 30.0 million visits between July and September 2019, before the pandemic affected international travel.While the estimated number of visits abroad was still well below pre-pandemic levels, the amount spent was similar.UK residents spent ¬£22.1 billion during visits abroad between July and September 2022, which was close to the ¬£21.9 billion spent during the same period in 2019. This could be an indication of the increased cost of living globally.A similar pattern was seen with overseas residents‚Äô visits to the UK. The 10.0 million visits made between July and September 2022 were down 16% from 11.9 million during the same period in 2019. Meanwhile, spending was similar for both periods, at ¬£9.2 billion and ¬£9.1 billion, respectively.

         <title>Largest negative terms-of-trade effect since 1970s</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/thetermsoftradethepurchasingpowerofgdp</link>
         <description>

Largest negative terms-of-trade effect since 1970s8 February 2023The impact of higher energy and commodity prices on the UK economy has lowered our terms of trade. This has reduced the UK‚Äôs purchasing power ‚Äî it can import fewer goods and services given the same level of exports. The consequences of this terms-of-trade effect is an unavoidable hit to UK real gross domestic income (GDI). The size and persistence of this effect will depend on how import and export prices evolve over the coming years, and how much of a net energy importer the UK continues to be. Real gross domestic income contracted by 0.2% in the year to Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2022. Many European countries have experienced a negative terms of trade effect as net energy importers. Italy, Germany and Japan are the G7 countries that have experienced a larger negative terms-of-trade effect than the UK over the last year. However, Norway saw the largest positive purchasing power effect among the OECD countries, while Canada and the Unites States are the only G7 countries to have had a positive terms-of-trade effect over the last year. This reflects how these countries are net energy exporters. 

The UK is currently experiencing its largest negative terms-of-trade effect since the mid-1970s

Notes:

We look at the 4-quarter change in real GDP and real GDI as a proxy of the underlying trend.
Positive values indicate a positive welfare effect, where the change in real GDI is higher than the change in real GDP. Negative values indicate a negative welfare effect, where the change in real GDI is lower than the change in real GDP.

         <title>Energy prices are main concern of one in five businesses</title>

         <description>

Energy prices are main concern of one in five businesses9 February 2023Nearly one in five (19%) businesses reported energy prices were their main concern for February 2023, when asked between 23 January and 5 February 2023. This was followed by inflation of goods and services prices (16%) and falling demand for goods and services (13%). In late January 2023, nearly two in five (37%) businesses had taken some form of action to reduce their energy costs in the last three months, with 23% of those businesses reporting they had switched electrical equipment off or on standby more than usual when not in use. Of the 45% of businesses that were not planning to reduce their energy costs in the next three months, 60% said their business‚Äôs energy efficiency had already been optimised.

Spending up in pubs and restaurants in early February9 February 2023Debit card spending in pubs and restaurants and on fast food rose above levels recorded before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the week to 5 February 2023.That was the first increase above the pre-pandemic baseline (the average for February 2020) since early December 2022, according to data collected by financial technology company Revolut.Debit card spending also rose in all categories monitored by the company when compared with the equivalent week of 2022. Spending was 47 percentage points higher on retail, and 39 percentage points greater for vehicle fuel.It is important to note that the figures are not adjusted for the potential effects of inflation (the rising price of goods and services) on the value of transactions.A separate indicator of debit and credit card spending, known as the CHAPS monthly index, shows that work-related spending (including on road fuel) in January 2023 was 15 percentage points higher than a year earlier.That was the largest increase of any category and was followed by ‚Äúsocial‚Äù and ‚Äústaple‚Äù spending, which both increased by 11 percentage points.Figures from job search engine Adzuna show that the number of online job adverts on 3 February 2023 was 21% lower than the number seen a year earlier.

Fuel imports increase for the first time since August 2022 10 February 2023Gas prices increased sharply contributing to a large increase in the value of gas imports from Norway in December 2022. When the effect of inflation is removed, fuel imports from non-EU countries increased by a much smaller amount in December 2022. The value of goods imported to the UK increased by ¬£1.6 billion (2.9%) in December 2022. After removing the effect of inflation, imports of goods increased by ¬£0.7 billion (1.5%). Imports of goods from EU countries increased by ¬£1.0 billion (3.8%) and imports from non-EU countries rose by ¬£0.5 billion (1.9%) in December 2022, in value terms. The value of goods exports decreased by ¬£0.8 billion (2.3%) in December 2022, linked to a fall in exports to non-EU countries. After removing the effect of inflation, total exports of goods decreased by ¬£0.1 billion (0.3%). The trade balance of exports and imports over the year for goods and services, excluding precious metals, widened by ¬£85.3 billion to a deficit of ¬£108.0 billion in 2022 when compared with 2021, driven by a 32.5% increase in import values. Imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries increased in December 2022EU and non-EU goods imports and exports, excluding precious metals, current prices, December 2019 to December 2022

Caution should be taken when interpreting these data as there is a discontinuity from January 2021 in EU trade following an HM Revenue and Customs data collection change. Our Impact of trade in goods data collection changes on UK trade statistics article, provides more detail.
Staged customs controls allowed traders importing goods from the EU to delay customs declarations in 2021 by up to 175 days, and as a result some double counting may have occurred between January and June 2022. Read our blog for more detail.

         <title>Around 1 in 30 adults miss work because of industrial action </title>

Around 1 in 30 adults miss work because of industrial action 10 February 2023Around 1 in 30 working adults reported that they missed work because of industrial action between 25 January and 5 February 2023. That is 3% of working adults across Britain, according to our latest Public Opinions and Social Trends Survey. That means 97% of respondents said they had not missed work as a result of industrial action. The survey period covers strike action by teachers, train drivers, civil servants and university staff, although the majority of responses came before the industrial action taken on 1 February. When asked about the important issues facing the UK today, 92% of adults cited the cost of living, which made it the most commonly reported issue. That was followed by the NHS (87%), the economy (77%), climate change and the environment (56%). There has been a slight increase in adults reporting the NHS as an important issue over the winter period, and a decrease in reporting climate change and the environment. This may be due to seasonal pressures and cold weather. 

The cost of living remains the most pressing concern
