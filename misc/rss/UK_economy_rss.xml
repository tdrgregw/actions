         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/consumerpriceinflationukjanuary2023</link>
         <description>Annual inflation continues to ease 15 February 2023 Prices of goods and services bought by consumers rose by 8.8% in the year to January 2023, down from 9.2% in the previous month, as the annual inflation rate continues to ease. This was according to the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers‚Äô housing costs (CPIH). This measure has been falling from a peak of 9.6% in October 2022, which was the highest rate in over 40 years, according to indicative modelled estimates . The easing of inflation has been driven by lower transport prices, particularly passenger transport.

         <title>Worker shortages higher in Wales</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/businessinsightsandimpactontheuksinglesitesubnationaleconomyfebruary2023</link>
         <description>Worker shortages higher in Wales 16 February 2023 Single-site businesses in Wales reported the largest proportion of firms experiencing worker shortages in the UK in early January 2023 - 16% of businesses in Wales experienced shortages, compared with 12% across the UK. It means Wales overtakes Scotland, which previously consistently reported the largest proportion of single-site businesses reporting a shortage of workers between late August 2022 and late November 2022. Between late August 2022 and early January 2023, Scotland saw a fall from 18% to 12%. Of all four UK nations, businesses in England were the least likely to report worker shortages in early January 2023, at 11%. As well as worker shortages, businesses were asked if they had been affected by industrial action. Of single-site businesses within the UK, England reported the largest proportion affected by industrial action every month between July and December 2022 (except for August 2022). England also saw a rise in affected businesses in this period, from 7% to 16%. In December 2022, 5% of single-site businesses in Northern Ireland reported being affected by industrial action, 11 percentage points below the UK single-site total (16%).

         <title>Low carbon and renewable energy economy sees record growth</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/lowcarbonandrenewableenergyeconomyuk2021</link>
         <description>Low carbon and renewable energy economy sees record growth 16 February 2023 Economic growth and employment levels within the UK‚Äôs low carbon and renewable energy economy (LCREE) increased at record rates between 2020 and 2021. During that time, turnover (the amount received in sales from goods and services in a specified time period) increased 30.8% to ¬£54.4 billion, while employment increased by 16.4% to 247,400 full-time equivalent positions. These represent the largest annual changes recorded for both metrics since comparable records began in 2015. These are also the highest levels that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has recorded for the two metrics since 2015. Businesses are considered part of the LCREE if their activities include economic activity in one or more of 17 sectors including renewable energy and sectors likely to help the UK generate lower greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. These sectors are combined into six larger groups of similar activities. In 2021, the ‚Äúenergy efficient products‚Äù group, which includes sectors of energy efficient lighting, energy efficient products and energy monitoring, saving or control systems, had the highest turnover (¬£19.6 billion) and largest employment level (138,300 full-time equivalents) of the six groups. This group also experienced the greatest increase in turnover between 2020 and 2021, growing 27.3%. The group with the largest increase in employment was ‚Äúlow emission vehicles and infrastructure‚Äù, growing 70.6% to 36,500 full-time equivalents between 2020 and 2021.

         <title>Retail sales increased in January 2023 </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/retailsalesgreatbritainjanuary2023</link>
         <description>Retail sales increased in January 2023 17 February 2023 Retail sales picked up slightly in January after December‚Äôs steep fall. Sales volumes (the amount of stuff bought) rose by 0.5% in January 2023, following a fall of 1.2% in December 2022. The sales growth was driven by various sectors including vehicle fuel, online retail, and non-food related retail such as cosmetics stores, carpets and furnishing stores, and watches and jewellery stores. However, the uptick in sales in January comes after a gradual drop in the amount bought from retailers since summer 2021. In the three months to January 2023, sales volumes fell by 0.9% when compared with the previous three months, and were 5.7% below the same period a year earlier. Retail sales have generally declined since summer 2021 Sales volume, seasonally adjusted, Great Britain, January 2020 to January 2023 Source: Office for National Statistics ‚Äì Monthly Business Survey ‚Äì Retail Sales Inquiry Download this chart Retail sales have generally declined since summer 2021 Image .csv .xls Food store sales volumes fell by 0.5% in January 2023 after a previous fall of 0.7% in December 2022, with some retailers continuing to report a drop in sales volumes because of the increased cost of living. Total retail sales volumes were 1.4% below their pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic levels in February 2020. However, in terms of value spent, retail sales had risen 14.0% over the same period.

         <title>Value of UK goods imports and exports rose in 2022</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/uktradeingoodsyearinreview2022</link>
         <description>Value of UK goods imports and exports rose in 2022 17 February 2023 The value of total goods imports increased by ¬£155.5 billion (32.3%) and the value of total goods exports increased by ¬£66.2 billion (20.8%) in 2022 when compared with 2021. However, after removing the effect of inflation (the rising price of goods and services), total goods imports increased by ¬£53.2 billion (11.5%) and total goods exports increased by just ¬£9.1 billion (2.9%) compared with 2021. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was a leading contributor to higher prices. It disrupted trade in multiple commodities, forced the UK to change some trade partners and led to increased import prices. The value of fuel imports increased by ¬£63.6 billion (119.1%) in 2022 when compared with 2021, driven by European gas prices reaching record levels. High fuel prices also had a knock-on effect on the price of other commodities because of increased transport and production costs. In December 2022, the Sterling to Euro exchange rate stood at 1.16, while the Sterling to Dollar exchange rate stood at 1.21. In both cases, these rates are down compared with the average exchange rate in 2021. Weaker exchange rates will have made the prices of imports higher while reducing the prices of UK exports.

         <title>Renters and parents more likely to be financially vulnerable</title>

         <description>Renters and parents more likely to be financially vulnerable 20 February 2023 Renters, younger adults (aged 25 to 34 years) and parents living with dependent children were among the groups most likely to experience some form of financial vulnerability. Adults were considered to have experienced some form of financial vulnerability if three or more of the following applied to them: being unable to afford an unexpected, but necessary, expense of ¬£850 borrowing more money or using more credit than usual in the last month, compared with a year ago being unable to save in the next 12 months finding it very or somewhat difficult to afford energy bills Adults aged 25 to 34 years had the highest odds of experiencing some form of financial vulnerability compared with those aged 75 years and over. Parents living with dependent children and those on lower incomes were also more likely to have experienced financial vulnerability than those without or not living with dependent children, or those earning more than ¬£50,000 per year. Renters had four times the odds of experiencing some form of financial vulnerability than those who owned their homes outright.

         <title>Record self-assessment receipts contribute to a January surplus</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/publicsectorfinancesukjanuary2023</link>
         <description>Record self-assessment receipts contribute to a January surplus 21 February 2023 In January 2023, the public sector spent less than it received in taxes and other income, resulting in a surplus of ¬£5.4 billion. The UK government receives most of its annual self-assessed tax receipts in January. This year these receipts were partly offset by substantial spending on the energy support schemes and large one-off payments relating to historic customs duties owed to the EU. Self-assessed income tax receipts were ¬£21.9 billion in January 2023. This is the highest January figure since monthly records began in April 1999, and ¬£5.5 billion or one-third higher than in January 2022. The ¬£5.4 billion surplus in January 2023, combined with a reduction of ¬£5.8 billion to our previously published financial year-to-December borrowing estimate, brings the total borrowed in the financial year-to-January to ¬£116.9 billion. This was ¬£7.0 billion more than was borrowed in the same period last year, but ¬£30.6 billion below the official forecast on a like-for-like basis. Debt at the end of January was ¬£2.5 trillion (¬£2,492.1 billion) or 98.9% of the UK‚Äôs annual gross domestic product (GDP).

         <title>Winter spending rises as inflation drives up prices</title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/howhasdiscretionaryspendingbeenimpactedinrecentwinters</link>
         <description>Winter spending rises as inflation drives up prices 21 February 2023 Non-essential consumer spending on sales days such as Boxing Day and Black Friday rose in winter 2022 to 2023, despite overall spending power being eroded. In the year to January 2023 retail sales values rose by 4.1% while sales volumes fell by 5.1%, as consumers spend more and buy less. Spending data from Revolut show consumer spending patterns in winter 2022-23 were generally in line with previous winters, despite cost of living pressures and widespread industrial action, alongside factors specific to this winter. Clothing and footwear sales volumes unexpectedly rose in November and December 2022, by 1.1% and 1.0% respectively. They peaked on Black Friday (25 November 2022) at 31.3% higher than Boxing Day and 77.0% higher than New Year‚Äôs Day. The week to Christmas Eve 2022 provided the largest cash value ever recorded for a trading week in the food sector, partly due to inflation, with the amount sold being similar to previous years. Industrial action carried out by rail and postal workers appears to have had no significant negative impact on travel spending, or in-store shopping, and the first ever winter FIFA World Cup did not result in substantial increases in spending on entertainment.
