         <description>UK GDP estimated to have fallen by 0.1% in May 2023 13 July 2023 Monthly real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have fallen by 0.1% in May 2023, with the production sector being the main contributor. This follows growth of 0.2% in April 2023. Looking at the broader picture, GDP showed no growth in the three months to May 2023 compared with the three months to February 2023. Production output fell by 0.6% in May 2023 after a fall of 0.2% in April 2023, revised up from a fall of 0.3% in the previous publication. This sector was the main contributor to the fall in monthly GDP in May. Services output showed no growth in May 2023, following a growth 0.3% in April 2023. Within the sector the largest increase came from Human health and social work activities, largely driven by an increase of 1.8% in Human health activities after falls in March and April. The construction sector fell by 0.2% in May 2023 following a fall of 0.9% in April 2023, revised down from a fall of 0.6% in the previous publication.

         <description>Renters more likely to be financially vulnerable 14 July 2023 Renters across Britain are nearly five (4.7) times as likely to be financially vulnerable as those who own their home outright. That was higher than people with mortgages, who on average were two (2.0) times as likely as people who own their own homes to be financially vulnerable. People aged 25 to 34 years and disabled adults also had greater odds of being financially vulnerable, according to our survey on the impact of increased cost of living covering the period 8 February to 1 May 2023 .

         <title>Falling motor fuel prices help ease inflation </title>
         <link>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/consumerpriceinflationukjune2023</link>
         <description>Falling motor fuel prices help ease inflation 19 July 2023 The rate at which prices of goods and services are rising eased to 7.3% in the year to June 2023, down from 7.9% in May. This is according to the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiersâ€™ housing costs (CPIH). It has fallen from a peak in October 2022, when the annual inflation rate stood at 9.6%, the highest in over 40 years, according to indicative modelled consumer price inflation estimates . The recent easing is mainly because of falls in petrol and diesel prices. Overall, motor fuel prices fell by 22.7% in the year to June 2023, after a fall of 13.1% in May. However, core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, remains at historic highs. Core CPIH rose by 6.4% in the year to June 2023, slightly down from 6.5% in May, which was the highest rate for more than 30 years.
